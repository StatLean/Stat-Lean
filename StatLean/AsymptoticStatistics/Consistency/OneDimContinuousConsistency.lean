# One-dimensional Z-estimator consistency, continuous case (van der Vaart, Lemma 5.10)

vdV, *Asymptotic Statistics* §5.2 ("Consistency"), Lemma 5.10, p. 47.

Let `Θ ⊆ ℝ`, let `Ψn` be random functions and `Ψ` a fixed function with
`Ψn(θ) →ₚ Ψ(θ)` for every `θ ∈ Θ`, and let `θ₀` be an **interior** point of `Θ`
(`Θ ∈ 𝓝 θ₀`) at which `Ψ` changes sign strictly (`Ψ θ < 0` for `θ ∈ Θ`, `θ < θ₀`;
`0 < Ψ θ` for `θ ∈ Θ`, `θ₀ < θ`). If each `θ ↦ Ψn(θ)` is **continuous on `Θ`** with
`θ̂ₙ` the **unique zero** in `Θ` (`hunique`), then the estimator sequence `θ̂ₙ` is
consistent: `P{ε ≤ |θ̂ₙ − θ₀|} → 0` for every `ε > 0`.

This is proved at **greater generality than vdV states**: the intermediate-value
route establishes existence of a zero in a small interval around `θ₀` and pins it to
`θ̂ₙ` via `hunique` on the convergence-relevant event, so vdV's setup facts "`θ̂ₙ` is a
zero", "`θ̂ₙ ∈ Θ`", and "`Θ` is an interval (order-connected)" are **not needed** — they
are recovered as instances (any genuine unique-zero estimator satisfies them). Only a
neighborhood of `θ₀` (`hθ₀_int`) and the local uniqueness `hunique` are used.

The nondecreasing half of Lemma 5.10 lives in the sibling file
`OneDimMonotoneConsistency.lean`.

**Interiority is genuinely needed here** (unlike the monotone case). The continuous
half of Lemma 5.10 is *false* at a boundary `θ₀`: e.g. `Θ = [0, ∞)`, `θ₀ = 0`,
`Ψn(x) = x` on `[0, n−1]` ramped down to a single zero at `x = n`, gives
`Ψn → Ψ = id` pointwise with each `Ψn` continuous with unique zero, yet `θ̂ₙ = n → ∞`.
Continuity alone cannot pin the zero from one side. So this theorem carries the
interiority hypothesis `hθ₀_int : Θ ∈ 𝓝 θ₀`, which vdV's "for every `ε > 0`" sign
condition tacitly presupposes through non-vacuity on both sides of `θ₀`.

The proof is purely set-theoretic on the measure side: it uses only `measure_mono`
and `measure_union_le`, so `P` is kept a completely general measure (no measurability
of `θ̂ₙ`, no `IsProbabilityMeasure`). The intermediate value theorem produces a zero of
`Ψn` inside a small `(θ₀ − δ, θ₀ + δ)` (with `δ ≤ ε` and `Icc(θ₀−δ)(θ₀+δ) ⊆ Θ` from
interiority) whenever `Ψn` is negative at `θ₀ − δ` and positive at `θ₀ + δ`; uniqueness
identifies it with `θ̂ₙ`.

/-- **van der Vaart, Lemma 5.10 (continuous unique-zero case), general `Θ ⊆ ℝ`.**
Let `θ₀` be an interior point of `Θ ⊆ ℝ`. If each `θ ↦ Ψn n ω θ` is continuous on `Θ`,
`θ̂ₙ` is the **unique zero** of `Ψn n ω` in `Θ` (`hunique`), `Ψn(θ) →ₚ Ψ(θ)` for every
`θ ∈ Θ`, and `Ψ` changes sign strictly across `θ₀` (`Ψ θ < 0` for `θ ∈ Θ`, `θ < θ₀`;
`0 < Ψ θ` for `θ ∈ Θ`, `θ₀ < θ`), then `θ̂ₙ` is consistent for `θ₀`.

Minimal-hypothesis form (see the module docstring): `θ̂ₙ` need not be assumed a zero or in
`Θ`, nor `Θ` order-connected — these are recovered on the good event, making this strictly
more general than vdV's stated setup. -/
