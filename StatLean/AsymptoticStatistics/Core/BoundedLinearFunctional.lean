# Globally bounded extensions of linear mean functionals

This file provides the theorem-agnostic bounded-extension layer used when a
statistical functional is identified only on a model class but pathwise
differentiability quantifies over unrestricted QMD paths.  The extension is made
globally bounded before applying the mass-method theorem from
`Core/LinearFunctional`.

The radius is `C + 1`, rather than `C`, because Mathlib's `truncation f A` uses
the half-open interval `(-A, A]`.  Since `C < C + 1`, this radius preserves every
value satisfying the closed bound `|f| ≤ C`, while Mathlib's global estimate
bounds the clipped function by `|C + 1|`.  Edge behavior: for negative `C` the
same literal radius `C + 1` is used.
