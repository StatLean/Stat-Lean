/-- A genuine one-sided tangent cone with an independently selected
nondominated QMD realization of every carrier score.

Constitutive (vdV §25.3 pp.362--363): the carrier is nonempty and closed
under nonnegative scaling; each member is a score realized by a one-sided
QMD path. Addition and negation are intentionally absent. The zero cone and
moving-atom paths show that these conditions are non-vacuous and do not imply
common domination. -/
