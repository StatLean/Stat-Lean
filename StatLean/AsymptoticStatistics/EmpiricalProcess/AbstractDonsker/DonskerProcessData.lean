# A constitutive bundle for a Donsker process

There are two complementary encodings of a `P`-Donsker class: the operational
Theorem-18.14 characterization
`IsPDonsker`, and the literal path-space convergence statement
`IsPDonskerWithBridge`. Theorem 19.23 needs both facets at once.

the Lean library. Edge behavior: no nonemptiness or envelope assumption is
added; those remain requirements of particular construction theorems. -/
