# Theorem 18.14 sufficiency (⟸): finite-net discretization

The hard direction of van der Vaart, *Asymptotic Statistics* Theorem 18.14
(book p.261): marginal CLT (`IsMarginalCLT`) + asymptotic equicontinuity
(`IsAsymptoticallyEquicontinuous`) ⟹ the empirical process converges weakly in
the outer sense `⇝ₒ` to the tight `P`-Brownian bridge `G_P = gaussianPBridge` in
`ℓ∞(F)`.

The vdV proof has four ingredients: finite `2⁻ᵐ`-net projections of
`(↥F, ρ_P)`, finite-dimensional convergence through each projection, outer-
probability control of the empirical projection error, and convergence of the
projected Brownian bridge to the full bridge.  A subadditive outer-expectation
estimate combines them in an ε/3 argument.  The resulting auxiliary theorem is
used by the headline characterization in `Characterization.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `finiteNetProj` — the coordinate-collapsing projection of `ℓ∞(F)` onto the
  finite `2⁻ᵐ`-net `Sₘ` of `(↥F, distL2 P)`.

## Main results

* `weakConvergesOuter_findim_proj` — the `m`-projected empirical process
  converges `⇝ₒ` to the `m`-projected `G_P` marginal (finite-dim CLT).
* `empirical_proj_error_outer` — the empirical discretization error
  `‖𝔾ₙ − πₘ𝔾ₙ‖_{ℓ∞(F)}` is asymptotically negligible as `m → ∞` (outer prob).
* `limit_proj_error` — the limit discretization error
  `∫ |f(πₘ z) − f z| dG_P` → 0 as `m → ∞` (a.s. UC paths + tightness + DCT).
* `isPDonsker'_of_marginalCLT_and_asymptoticallyEquicontinuous_aux` — the
  ε/3 assembly, packaged so the headline theorem in `Characterization.lean` is a
  one-line application.

/-! ### Finite-dimensional convergence

`weakConvergesOuter_findim_proj` is the finite-dimensional CLT through the
net. It is HIGH-risk: the projected map is `LinfF F`-valued (not a finite tuple),
the marginal CLT (`IsMarginalCLT.fdd`) and the Gaussian limit
(`gaussianPBridge`'s `isGaussian_fdd`) are both phrased as **finite-tuple**
(`Fin k → ℝ`) coordinate readouts, and `gaussianPBridge` is a `choose` witness
exposing only the `IsPBrownianBridge` field set. The proof splits into explicit
sublemmas. The result at the bottom is a `weakConvergesOuter_of_measurable` reduction
plus an application of `weakConverges_findim_proj_of_marginalCLT`. -/

/-- **Coordinate measurability of the empirical process** (for a
genuinely Borel-measurable readout `g`). For a measurable `g : Ω → ℝ`, the
coordinate evaluation `ξ ↦ empiricalProcess P n (X· ξ) g` is measurable
`Ξ → ℝ`: it is `√n` times the difference of the empirical average
`n⁻¹ ∑ᵢ g (X i ξ)` (a finite sum of the measurable maps `ξ ↦ g (X i ξ) = g ∘ X i`,
each measurable since `X i` is measurable and `g` is Borel) and the constant
`∫ g dP`.

NOTE on the carrier map (route subtlety, important downstream): the full map
`ξ ↦ 𝔾ₙ ξ` into `ℓ∞(F)` is in general **NOT** Borel measurable for uncountable
`F` — this non-measurability is precisely why the abstract-Donsker theory uses
outer expectation `E*`. Even the *projected* map reads finitely many functions
`s ∈ Sₘ ⊆ F`, but those are only `AEStronglyMeasurable s P` (via `hF_meas`), so
`ξ ↦ s (X i ξ)` is only `μ`-a.e. measurable — Borel measurability of
`measurable_projectedEmpirical` therefore requires passing to measurable
representatives `s' =ᵐ[P] s` and using that pushforward laws are insensitive to
`μ`-a.e. modification (the same representative machinery as
`marginalCLT_fdd_of_iid` in `Donsker.lean`). This lemma is the measurable-readout
core of that argument.

This is the per-coordinate measurability bridge for the empirical process. -/

Both projected-process measurability and the finite-dimensional CLT in law factor

`Sₘ = Set.range (netRep m)` is finite (`finite_range_netRep`). We package this
once: the finite index type `netIndex m`, the continuous coordinate-collapse
reconstruction `netRecon m`, and the factorization

Each net coordinate `s : ↥Sₘ` is (the subtype packaging of) a member of `F`:

`hF_meas : ∀ f ∈ F, Measurable f` supplies `Measurable (s.1 : Ω → ℝ)` directly.
`measurable_empiricalProcess_coord` evaluates `s` **pointwise** at the

`AEStronglyMeasurable … P`) form. As in vdV, `F` is a class of measurable
functions, and `hF_meas` supplies exactly this property. -/

/-- **Measurability of the projected empirical process.** The composite

Unlike the un-projected `𝔾ₙ`, the projected map reads only the FINITE net
`Sₘ = range (netRep m)` (finite by `finite_range_netRep`): `(πₘ (𝔾ₙ ξ)) t`
equals `(𝔾ₙ ξ) (netRep m t)`, which takes values in the finite set of coordinates
`{(𝔾ₙ ξ) s : s ∈ Sₘ}`. The map therefore factors through the finite-dimensional
coordinate space `ℝ^{Sₘ}` as `(finite coordinate restriction) ∘ (ℝ^{Sₘ}-recon)`;
the restriction is measurable because each coordinate `ξ ↦ (𝔾ₙ ξ) s` is measurable
by `measurable_empiricalProcess_coord`, and the reconstruction
`ℝ^{Sₘ} → LinfF F` is continuous (so the Borel σ-algebra obstruction that defeats
the un-projected map does not arise). This is the genuine measurability content of
the discretization.

The finite-net factorization makes the projected process measurable. -/

/-- **Euclidean Gaussian identity.** The `ψ`-readout
pushforward of the `P`-Brownian bridge `G_P`, where `ψ i = (netEnum m).symm i ∈ ↥F`,
equals the marginal Gaussian `multivariateGaussian 0 (marginalCovMatrix P (netPhi m))`
on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)`.

Both are centred Gaussian (mean 0): the readout law is Gaussian by
`pBridge_isGaussian_fdd`; the multivariate Gaussian by construction. Their
covariances agree entrywise: `cov[z(ψ i), z(ψ j); G_P] = P(ψi·ψj) − Pψi·Pψj`
(`pBridge_cov`, plus mean-zero) `= marginalCovEntry P (netPhi m) i j` (since
`(netPhi m) i = ψ i` as `Ω → ℝ`). Two centred Gaussians with equal covariance are
equal (`IsGaussian.ext`).

The proof uses `IsGaussian.ext` on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)`:
* **IsGaussian (LHS).** `pBridge_isGaussian_fdd m ψ` gives `IsGaussian` of the
  `Fin k → ℝ` (Pi) readout law `ν.map (fun z => fun i => z (ψ i))`; transport to
  the `EuclideanSpace` readout via `WithLp.toLp 2` (a continuous linear equiv, so
  pushforward preserves Gaussianity: `map_map` + `IsGaussian.map` of a CLE).
* **Mean 0.** `μ[id] = 0` for both. For the bridge readout,
  `gaussianPBridge_readout_mean` supplies the coordinatewise mean-zero identity;
  for `multivariateGaussian 0 S` it is
  `integral_id_multivariateGaussian'`.
* **Covariance.** `covarianceBilin` equality reduces (basis pairs) to
  `cov[xᵢ,xⱼ]` matching: `covariance_eval_multivariateGaussian` gives `S i j =
  marginalCovEntry P (netPhi m) i j`; for the bridge, `cov = second moment` (by
  mean-zero) `= pBridge_cov (ψ i) (ψ j) = marginalCovEntry`. -/

/-- **Standard-form reconciliation and enumeration.** The net-coordinate
empirical readout equals the reindexed `IsMarginalCLT`-standardised vector,
pointwise in `ξ`. For every `ξ` and net point `s`,
`netTuple m (𝔾ₙ ξ) s = netReindex m (stdVec n ξ) s`, where
`stdVec n ξ = (√n)⁻¹ • (∑_{j<n} tupleVec (netPhi m) (X_j ξ) − n • E[tupleVec (netPhi m) (X_0)])`.

This is the algebraic identity reconciling `empiricalProcess`'s `√n(Pₙ − P)f`
centring with the standardised-sum form: for `s` with `netPhi m (netEnum m s) = s.1`,
the coordinate `(√n)⁻¹(∑_j s.1(X_jξ) − n∫ s.1 dP)` equals
`√n(n⁻¹∑_j s.1(X_jξ) − ∫ s.1 dP) = empiricalProcess P n (X·ξ) s.1`
(using `(√n)⁻¹·n = √n` and `E[s.1(X_0)] = ∫ s.1 dP` via `hX_law`).

This is the standardisation-form bridge between the two centrings. -/

/-- **The finite-dimensional CLT through the net, in law form.** The pushforward
laws of the projected empirical process `μ.map (πₘ ∘ 𝔾ₙ)` converge weakly to the
`πₘ`-pushforward of `G_P = gaussianPBridge`.

This is the analytic core of finite-dimensional convergence. The projected map
`πₘ z` depends only on the values of `z` on the finite net
`Sₘ = range (netRep m)` (finite by
`finite_range_netRep`), so both `μ.map (πₘ ∘ 𝔾ₙ)` and `gaussianPBridge.map πₘ`
factor through the finite-dimensional coordinate space `ℝ^{Sₘ}`. On that space the
convergence is exactly the finite-dim CLT: enumerate `Sₘ` as a tuple
`φ : Fin k → ↥F`, apply `IsMarginalCLT.fdd` to get
`TendstoInDistribution → multivariateGaussian 0 (marginalCovMatrix P (φ ·))`, and
identify that Gaussian with the `φ`-readout of `gaussianPBridge` via the covariance
match `pBridge_cov = marginalCovEntry` + `pBridge_isGaussian_fdd` (two centred
Gaussians with equal covariance are equal). The continuous reconstruction
`ℝ^{Sₘ} → LinfF F` (a coordinate-collapse, continuous) then transports the
finite-tuple weak convergence to the `LinfF F`-valued statement via the
continuous-mapping theorem `WeakConverges.map`.

/-- **Finite-dimensional CLT through the net `Sₘ`.** For each fixed scale
`m`, the `πₘ`-projected empirical process converges weakly in the outer sense to
the pushforward of `G_P = gaussianPBridge` under `πₘ`.

The projected map `ξ ↦ finiteNetProj m (𝔾ₙ ξ)` factors through the finite-
dimensional coordinate space `ℝ^{Sₘ}`, hence is Borel-measurable by
`measurable_projectedEmpirical`; so `weakConvergesOuter_of_measurable`
reduces the `⇝ₒ` claim to ordinary weak convergence of pushforwards
by `weakConverges_findim_proj_of_marginalCLT`, which is exactly the
finite-dim CLT `IsMarginalCLT.fdd` evaluated on the net tuple. Covariance
identification of the limit with the `πₘ`-pushforward of the `G_P` marginal
uses `pBridge_cov` and `pBridge_isGaussian_fdd`.

/-- **The empirical discretization error is asymptotically negligible.** For
every `ε > 0`, the outer probability that the `ℓ∞(F)`-distance between the
empirical process `𝔾ₙ` and its net projection `πₘ𝔾ₙ` exceeds `ε` tends to `0` as
`m → ∞`, uniformly in `n` in the `limsupₙ` sense.

The sup-norm error is majorized by `supNormOver (localized 2⁻ᵐ-class) 𝔾ₙ` via
`empiricalProcess_sub` (the coordinates of `𝔾ₙ − πₘ𝔾ₙ` are differences
`𝔾ₙ f − 𝔾ₙ (netRep m f)` of `2⁻ᵐ`-close pairs). The `m → ∞` vanishing of its
`limsupₙ` is the chaining content of `hF_ent`
(`localizedChainBound_of_finiteEntropy` / `equicontinuity_chaining_assembly_brick`
in `ChainingAssembly.lean`); the genuinely-new content here is the lift of that
real-valued/`∫⁻` bound to the **outer probability** `E*`/`P*`.

/-! ### The ε/3 assembly

The ε/3 readout split (vdV p.261) factors through two generic outer-expectation
lemmas (`outerReadout_le_of_modulus`, the one-sided readout majorant;
and the symmetric two-sided `abs_outerReadout_diff_le`) and the per-`f`
ε/3 combiner `tendsto_outerReadout_of_pieces`. -/

/-- **One-sided readout majorant (real form).** For probability `μ`, a
bounded continuous readout `f`, two maps `X Y : Ξ → D`, a net scale `δ` and a
continuity modulus `η ≥ 0` with `f (X ξ) ≤ f (Y ξ) + η` on the *good* event
`{dist (X ξ) (Y ξ) ≤ δ}`, the shifted outer readout of `f ∘ X` is bounded by the
readout of `f ∘ Y` plus `η` plus `2‖f‖ · (outer measure of the bad event)`.

This is the real-valued `.toReal` packaging of `outerExpectation_readout_triangle`:
the error is `η + 2‖f‖ · 1_{δ < dist}`, with `Lip = 1`; finiteness of
both readouts (each `≤ 2‖f‖ · μ univ < ⊤`) lets `.toReal` distribute. -/

the unprojected readout `R n → L` as `n→∞`. This is the ε/3 limsup-combine: the
discretization tail is folded into the single limiting hypothesis `hDtail`, supplied
by the asymptotic-tightness lemma `empirical_readout_tail_outer` at the call site.

`hDbdd` (eventual upper-boundedness of `Dtail m` in `n`) is the mechanical side
condition of `eventually_lt_of_limsup_lt` over `ℝ` (a `ConditionallyCompleteLinearOrder`,
not `ℝ≥0∞`): without it `limsup` is junk on an unbounded sequence. At the call
site `Dtail m n = (E*[…]).toReal ≤ 2‖f‖`, so the constant `2‖f‖` discharges it. -/

/-- **Empirical readout-tail vanishing (vdV's Lipschitz argument).** For a
*bounded-Lipschitz* `f : LinfF F →ᵇ ℝ`, the `n`-`limsup` of the pointwise-gap
`E*`-readout `E*[ |f(𝔾ₙ) − f(πₘ𝔾ₙ)| ]` tends to `0` as `m → ∞`.

This is van der Vaart's own readout-difference bound (book p.261-262), which does
*not* build an asymptotically-tight compact set for the empirical process. For a
`K`-Lipschitz `f`, split at the fixed oscillation threshold `ε`:
`|f(𝔾ₙ) − f(πₘ𝔾ₙ)| ≤ K·ε + 2‖f‖·𝟙{ε < ‖𝔾ₙ − πₘ𝔾ₙ‖}`, so the readout obeys
`Dtail m n ≤ K·ε + 2‖f‖·P*{ε < ‖𝔾ₙ − πₘ𝔾ₙ‖}`. The second factor's `limsupₙ`
vanishes as `m → ∞` by the empirical discretization-error theorem
`empirical_proj_error_outer`, leaving
`limsupₘ limsupₙ Dtail ≤ K·ε`. Since `ε > 0` is arbitrary, the tail tends to `0`.

The Lipschitz hypothesis is essential: a merely bounded-*continuous* `f` on the
non-compact `ℓ∞(F)` has no global modulus, so this bound fails for it. The upgrade
to all bounded-continuous test functions happens at the headline theorem via the
inf-convolution portmanteau `weakConvergesOuter_of_lipschitz_readout`.

vdV p.261-262 (⟸): the readout-difference step for bounded-Lipschitz test
functions, controlled by empirical equicontinuity alone. -/

/-- **The ε/3 assembly of Theorem 18.14 sufficiency (⟸).** Packaged for the
headline theorem in `Characterization.lean`: under the marginal CLT and
asymptotic equicontinuity, the empirical process converges `⇝ₒ` to `G_P` in
`ℓ∞(F)`.

For each `f : LinfF F →ᵇ ℝ`, split the readout error into three pieces:
the `n → ∞` finite-dimensional convergence at fixed `m`
(`weakConvergesOuter_findim_proj`), the empirical tail `‖𝔾ₙ − πₘ𝔾ₙ‖` lifted
through the subadditive `E*`-triangle (`empirical_proj_error_outer` and
`outerExpectation_readout_triangle`), and the limit tail
`∫|f(πₘ·) − f·| dG_P` (`limit_proj_error`). Choosing `m` large
(controls both tails) then `n` large (controls the middle) gives the ε/3 bound.

The conclusion is the per-`f` `WeakConvergesOuter` *readout-Tendsto* for a fixed
bounded-Lipschitz `f` (the body of `WeakConvergesOuter` at one test function), so the
headline theorem in `Characterization.lean` builds the family `hlip` of these and
upgrades to the full `WeakConvergesOuter` (all bounded-*continuous* `f`) via the
bounded-Lipschitz portmanteau `weakConvergesOuter_of_lipschitz_readout`. The Lipschitz
hypothesis `hf_lip` is consumed only by the empirical-tail piece (`_Dtail`); the
other three pieces (`_middle` / `_limtail` / `_hdiff` / `_hDbdd`) are `f`-agnostic.

bounded-Lipschitz test function. -/
