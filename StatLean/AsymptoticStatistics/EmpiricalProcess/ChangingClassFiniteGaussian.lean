/-- The Gaussian finite-partition approximation on `LinfT T`.

Constitutive (vdV Theorem 18.14, as used in Theorem 19.28): this is the
finite-dimensional centered Gaussian law reconstructed as a path constant on
each cell. Edge behavior: if the finite covariance cut is not positive
semidefinite, Mathlib's `multivariateGaussian` is the Dirac mass at zero, so
this definition remains a probability measure without an extra hypothesis.

/-- A finite-partition Gaussian approximation is tight, with no countability
assumption on the target index type. Tightness is transported from the
finite-dimensional Euclidean Gaussian law through continuous reconstruction.

/-- Finite-partition projections converge in distribution to their
reconstructed Gaussian laws.

This is the continuous mapping theorem applied to finite-dimensional
convergence, followed by identification of the limiting pushforward law.
