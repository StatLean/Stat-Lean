# Empirical measure of a finite sample

Given a sample $X_1, \dots, X_n$ taking values in a measurable space $\Omega$, the
**empirical measure** is the discrete probability measure that places mass $1/n$ at
each observation,
$$\mathbb{P}_n \;=\; \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \delta_{X_i},$$
where $\delta_x$ is the Dirac point mass at $x$. It is the natural (unbiased) estimator
of an underlying distribution $P$: for any integrable $f$ the empirical average
$$\mathbb{P}_n f \;=\; \int f \, d\mathbb{P}_n \;=\; \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(X_i)$$
estimates $P f = \int f \, dP$. When $n \ge 1$, $\mathbb{P}_n$ is a probability measure
(total mass $1$). All higher-level empirical-process objects (the centred empirical
process $\mathbb{G}_n$, the Glivenko–Cantelli predicate, the Donsker predicate) are
stated in terms of integrals against this measure or, equivalently, against the
real-valued empirical-average shorthand `empiricalAvg`.

Main declarations: `empiricalMeasure`, `empiricalAvg`.

**Reference.** A. W. van der Vaart, *Asymptotic Statistics*, Cambridge Series in
Statistical and Probabilistic Mathematics, Cambridge University Press, 1998. Chapter 19
(Empirical Processes), §19.1. (The empirical measure $\mathbb{P}_n$ and the notation
$\mathbb{P}_n f$ for $\frac1n\sum_i f(X_i)$ are introduced there as the basic objects of
the chapter.)

**Proof formalization notes.** The Lean definition `empiricalMeasure n X` is
$(n : \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^{\infty})^{-1} \cdot \sum_i \mathrm{dirac}(X_i)$, a scalar
multiple of a finite sum of Dirac measures. Edge behaviour: for $n = 0$ the index set
`Fin 0` is empty, the sum is the zero measure, and the prefactor
$(0 : \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^{\infty})^{-1} = \infty$ collapses against the zero measure to
leave the zero measure; the `IsProbabilityMeasure` instance is therefore stated under the
`[NeZero n]` hypothesis. The probability-measure proof evaluates total mass via
`Measure.smul_apply` / `Measure.coe_finset_sum`, uses
`Measure.dirac_apply_of_mem` to get each $\delta_{X_i}(\Omega) = 1$, sums to $n$, and
closes with `ENNReal.inv_mul_cancel`. The real shorthand `empiricalAvg f n X` is
$(n : \mathbb{R})^{-1} \cdot \sum_i f(X_i)$; here Lean's convention
$(0 : \mathbb{R})^{-1} = 0$ makes the $n = 0$ case evaluate to $0$. The accompanying
lemmas record that `empiricalAvg` is linear in $f$ (additivity `empiricalAvg_add`,
scalar homogeneity `empiricalAvg_smul`) and vanishes on the zero function.

**Bibliographic comments.** The empirical measure is folklore foundational
material with no single seminal originating paper. Its scalar-CDF special case, the
empirical distribution function $F_n(t) = \frac1n\#\{i : X_i \le t\}$, traces to the
uniform-convergence results of V. Glivenko, "Sulla determinazione empirica delle leggi di
probabilità," *Giornale dell'Istituto Italiano degli Attuari* 4 (1933), 92–99, and
F. P. Cantelli, "Sulla determinazione empirica delle leggi di probabilità," same volume,
421–424. The general empirical-measure-on-an-abstract-space viewpoint used here is the
modern synthesis presented in van der Vaart (1998, Chapter 19) and in A. W. van der Vaart
and J. A. Wellner, *Weak Convergence and Empirical Processes*, Springer, 1996.

Edge: for `n = 0`, the indexing `Fin 0` is empty and the sum is the
zero measure; the scaling `(0 : ℝ≥0∞)⁻¹ = ∞` collapses against `0`
to leave the zero measure. The `IsProbabilityMeasure` instance is
therefore stated under `[NeZero n]`.
