# Universal measurability of analytic sets

This file derives compact inner approximation for analytic subsets of Polish spaces
from the general Choquet-capacity theorem, then assembles the finite-measure result into
the s-finite public API used by measurable selection.

## Main declarations

* `MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.exists_isCompact_measure_diff_lt`
* `MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.nullMeasurableSet`

The dependency chain is `ChoquetCapacity.Basic` → `ChoquetCapacity.Analytic` →
this file → `MeasurableSelection`.
