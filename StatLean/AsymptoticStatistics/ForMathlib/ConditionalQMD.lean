# Conditional quadratic-mean-differentiable paths (censoring-kernel form)

Reference: van der Vaart, *Asymptotic Statistics* (Cambridge, 1998), §25.5.3
(Coarsening At Random, book p.379-381).

This file introduces the *conditional* analogue of `Core.QMDPath.QMDPath`: a
differentiable submodel `t ↦ rₜ(δ | y)` of the conditional density of the
censoring/coarsening variable `Δ` given the full observation `Y`, together with
its per-fibre score `b₀(δ | y)`. Where `QMDPath` differentiates a curve of
full-data laws `t ↦ Pₜ`, `ConditionalQMDPath` differentiates a curve of Markov
kernels `t ↦ rₜ : Kernel 𝓨 𝓓`, with the Hellinger limit taken against the
*product* reference `Q ⊗ ν` on `𝓨 × 𝓓`, with `P_full = Q ⊗ₘ r`.

The genuinely deep censoring-score facts that CAR forces on `b₀`:
  * `conditionalScore_factorsThrough` — `b₀(δ | y)` is a function of `x = M(y,δ)`
    only (proved in `ParametricFamily/CARScore.lean`);
  * `conditionalScore_fibre_mean_zero` — `∫ b₀(δ|y) r(δ|y) dν(δ) = 0` for a.e. `y`
    (proved below).

Headline declarations: `ConditionalQMDPath`, `conditionalScore_fibre_mean_zero`.

/-- A *conditional quadratic-mean-differentiable path* of the censoring kernel
`r : Kernel 𝓨 𝓓` at reference measures `Q` (on `𝓨`) and `ν` (on `𝓓`): a curve
`t ↦ curve t : ℝ → Kernel 𝓨 𝓓` of Markov kernels through `r` (at `t = 0`), each
fibre `curve t y` dominated by `ν`, with per-fibre score field
`score : 𝓨 → 𝓓 → ℝ` (`b₀(δ | y)`) whose half is the L²(Q ⊗ ν) derivative of the
square-root conditional density.

Reference: vdV §25.5.3, book p.380 (differentiable submodel of the conditional
censoring density under CAR). This is the *conditional* analogue of
`Core.QMDPath.QMDPath`; the double-integral Hellinger limit against `Q ⊗ ν` is
the fibrewise QMD condition integrated over the covariate law `Q`. -/

/-- *Per-fibre mean-zero of the conditional score* (vdV §25.5.3, book p.380).

For a.e. covariate value `y` (in fact for *every* `y`), the conditional score
integrates to zero against its own fibre: `∫ b₀(δ | y) r(δ | y) dν(δ) = 0`,
equivalently `∫ b₀(δ | y) d(r y)(δ) = 0`. This is the per-fibre specialisation of
the mean-zero half of vdV lem:25.14 (the score of a QMD path has mean zero).

Book excerpt (vdV p.380): "Because it corresponds to a score for the conditional
model, it is further restricted by the equations
`∫ b₀(δ | y) r(δ | y) dν(δ) = E_R(b(X) | Y = y) = 0` for every `y`."

Proof: apply `QMDAnalytic.integral_score_eq_zero_of_qmd` to each fibre
`t ↦ curve t y` — a dominated QMD path against `ν` with score `b₀(· | y)`,
witnessed by the constitutive `qmd_limit_fibre` field — then rewrite
`curve 0 = r`. The identity is pointwise in `y`, so no Fubini descent from the
joint limit is needed (that descent is in fact invalid; see `qmd_limit_fibre`). -/
