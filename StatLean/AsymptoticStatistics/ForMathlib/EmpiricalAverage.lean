# Empirical averages of finite samples

The empirical average of a real-valued function over a sample indexed by `Fin n`,
with its elementary additive and scalar-multiplication identities. This definition
is independent of measure theory and is shared by the probability and empirical-
process layers.

/-- The **empirical average** of `f` on the sample `X`:
`empiricalAvg f n X = (1/n) · Σᵢ f (X i)`.

Edge: for `n = 0`, the sum is empty and the prefactor `(0 : ℝ)⁻¹ = 0`
in Lean's convention, so the whole expression is `0`.

This is the real-valued shorthand for integration against an empirical measure,
in the form used in the proof of vdV Theorem 19.4. -/
