# A centred Gaussian random variable is sub-Gaussian with proxy variance = its variance

This file is a small, reusable bridge between the Gaussian distribution API and the
sub-Gaussian MGF API in Mathlib.

Mathematical content.  If `Y : Ω → ℝ` has law `N(0, σ²)` under `μ` (i.e.
`μ.map Y = gaussianReal 0 σ2`), then `Y` is *sub-Gaussian* with proxy variance `σ²`:
its moment-generating function satisfies `mgf Y μ t ≤ exp(σ² t² / 2)` for every `t`,
and `ω ↦ exp(t·Y ω)` is integrable for every `t`.  For a centred Gaussian the bound
is in fact an *equality* — the mean-`0` Gaussian MGF is `exp(σ² t² / 2)` — so the
sub-Gaussian proxy variance is sharp and equal to the true variance.

This supplies the Gaussian-to-sub-Gaussian connection for the Brownian-bridge
chaining argument: the increments of the isonormal process are
Gaussian, and via this lemma they feed the generic sub-Gaussian maximal inequality
`expectation_iSup_abs_le_of_subgaussian` and the concentration bound
`HasSubgaussianMGF.measure_ge_le`.

Bricks used:
* `ProbabilityTheory.mgf_gaussianReal` — closed form of the Gaussian MGF.
* `ProbabilityTheory.integrable_exp_mul_gaussianReal` — integrability of `exp(t·x)`
  against a Gaussian, pulled back through the law via `integrable_map_measure`.

/-- A random variable with centred Gaussian law `N(0, σ²)` is sub-Gaussian with proxy
variance equal to its variance `σ²`.

The measurability hypothesis `hY : AEMeasurable Y μ` is needed to pull integrability of `exp(t·x)`
back through the law `μ.map Y` via `integrable_map_measure`.

The hypothesis `h` gives the mean-`0` Gaussian law `μ.map Y = gaussianReal 0 σ2`,
the genuine mathematical content (centred Gaussian of variance `σ²`).

For a centred Gaussian the MGF is exactly `exp(σ² t² / 2)`, so the sub-Gaussian bound
`mgf Y μ t ≤ exp(σ² t² / 2)` holds with equality. -/

/-- **Monotonicity in the proxy variance.** A sub-Gaussian random variable with proxy
variance `c` is also sub-Gaussian with any larger proxy variance `c'`: the MGF bound
`mgf Y μ t ≤ exp(c·t²/2)` only weakens when `c` grows to `c'`.  Mean-agnostic: the
sub-Gaussian definition forces `E[Y] = 0` regardless of the proxy variance, and the
integrability requirement is unchanged.

The order hypothesis `hcc' : c ≤ c'` makes the proxy bound monotone. -/
