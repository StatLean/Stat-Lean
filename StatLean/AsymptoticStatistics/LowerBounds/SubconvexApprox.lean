# Bounded subconvex approximation from below

Every subconvex (bowl-shaped) loss is monotonically approximable from below by
**bounded subconvex** losses. This reduces the local asymptotic minimax bound for a
general subconvex `ℓ` to the bounded case: apply the bounded case to `ℓ_M = ℓ ∧ M`
and let `M ↑ ∞` by monotone convergence, since `ℓ_M` is again subconvex.

Reference: van der Vaart, *Asymptotic Statistics* (Cambridge, 1998), §25.3,
proof of Theorem 25.21.

The construction is the canonical truncation `ℓ_seq M x := ℓ x ⊓ (M : ℝ≥0∞)`, which
is exactly what the book uses; sublevel-set preservation is `BowlShaped.truncate`.
Only bounded + subconvex + monotone convergence is needed, so uniform continuity is
not required of the truncations.

Headline declaration: `subconvex_approx`.

/-- *Bounded subconvex approximation from below.* Every nonneg subconvex
(bowl-shaped) loss `ℓ : ℝᵏ → ℝ≥0∞` admits a sequence `ℓ_seq M : ℝᵏ → ℝ≥0∞`
of **bounded subconvex** functions with `ℓ_seq M x ↑ ℓ x` pointwise.

The construction is the canonical truncation `ℓ_seq M x := ℓ x ⊓ M` used
verbatim in van der Vaart's proof of Theorem 25.21.

Reference: vdV §25.3, proof of Theorem 25.21.

The "bounded" clause is encoded as `B M ≠ ∞`: a finite cap on `ℓ_seq M`.
Uniform continuity of the truncations is not needed: the book's argument
requires only bounded + subconvex + monotone convergence. -/
