# Probability differentiability adapter for M-estimators

This file is the thin subject-layer bridge from the generic local-scale `L²`
theorem to the exact `distL2` premise consumed by the fixed-direction
empirical-process adapters for vdV Theorems 5.23 and 5.39.

/-- The samplewise continuous-linear derivative canonically determined by the
coordinate family `mdot` used by the M-estimator empirical-process layer.

It bundles `mdot` with `psiVec` and takes the real inner-product functional.
Thus the derivative content is fixed by `mdot`; there is no free derivative or
compatibility equality for callers to supply.  Edge behavior: for `d = 0` this
is the unique zero functional on the zero-dimensional Euclidean space. -/

/-- Convert generic fixed-direction local-scale `L²(P)` convergence into the
exact `distL2` premise of
`linearization_marginal_tendstoInProbZero_of_distL2`.

The target inner product is obtained from `mdotProbabilityDerivative` by
symmetry of the real inner product, not by assuming a provider equality.
Neither score measurability nor score `L²` membership is an input: both are
consequences of probability differentiability plus the common envelope. -/
