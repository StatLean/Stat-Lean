# CAR observed-tangent decomposition and IPW influence functions (vdV §25.5.3)

Reference: van der Vaart, *Asymptotic Statistics* (Cambridge, 1998), §25.5.3:
thm:25.40 (book p.380 — observed tangent = Q-score images ⊕ coarsening scores)
and lem:25.41 (book p.381-382 — the IPW form of an observed influence function).

Here `b` is constrained to the *coarsening-score space* `coarseningScores`, the
orthogonal complement of the observed image of the Q-model tangent.

## Why the complement is taken against the *Q-model* image, not all of `Π`

Over a generic `P_full`, `Π = informationLossOperator hM P_full` is **surjective**
(pull an observed `g` back to the `M`-measurable full-data function `g ∘ M`, whose
`Π`-image is `g`), so `(range Π)ᗮ = {0}` — the coarsening piece would be trivial.
The book's non-trivial `b` piece arises because `Π` is applied to the **Q-model
tangent** `fullTangent` (scores that are functions of `Y` with `Qa = 0`), a proper
subspace. Hence `coarseningScores := (observedTangent hM P_full fullTangent)ᗮ`.

## Why closure enters the decomposition

The observed tangent *set* `Π '' fullTangent` need not be closed; thm:25.40 is a
statement about its **closure** being all mean-zero `L²(P_obs)`. The exact
orthogonal decomposition therefore splits `g` against the closed subspace
`(observedTangent …).topologicalClosure`, matching vdV's "the closure consists of
all mean-zero functions".

Headline declarations: `coarseningScores`, `observedTangent_orthogonal_decomposition`.

by `ParametricFamily.CARScore.conditionalScore_factorsThrough` +

scores `b(x)` that are functions of the observed data with `E_R(b(X) | Y) = 0` a.s.

of `E_R(b | Y) = 0`. -/

/-! ### Orthogonality of the two pieces -/

/-- *Coarsening scores are orthogonal to the observed Q-score image* (vdV
§25.5.3, the orthogonality engine of thm:25.40).

For a Q-model score `a ∈ fullTangent`, the conditional-expectation piece
`Π a = E_{Q,R}(a(Y) | X)` pairs to zero with every coarsening score `b`. This is
the abstract form of vdV's tower identity `⟪E(a(Y)|X), b⟫ = E[a(Y)·E_R(b|Y)] = 0`;
it follows from `b ∈ (observedTangent fullTangent)ᗮ` together with
`Operators.CAR.inner_observedTangent_piece`, and supplies the orthogonality used
in the decomposition `g = Π a + b`. -/

/-! ### Density and closure via orthogonality -/

/-- *An observed score orthogonal to both pieces is zero* (vdV §25.5.3, thm:25.40
¶2 density half).

If a mean-zero observed score `g` is orthogonal to the whole observed Q-score image
(`observedTangent hM P_full fullTangent`) and to every coarsening score, then
`g = 0`. This is the closure statement of thm:25.40: the observed image of the
Q-model tangent together with the coarsening scores spans a dense subspace, so
nothing nonzero is orthogonal to both. Self-contained: `g ⊥ observedTangent`
places `g ∈ (observedTangent)ᗮ = coarseningScores`, and then `g ⊥ coarseningScores`
forces `⟪g, g⟫ = 0`. -/

/-! ### Orthogonal decomposition -/

/-- *vdV thm:25.40 — observed-tangent orthogonal decomposition* (book p.380).

Every mean-zero observed score `g ∈ L²₀(P_obs)` decomposes orthogonally as
`g = p + b`, where:
  * `p ∈ (observedTangent hM P_full fullTangent).topologicalClosure` — a limit of
    conditional-expectation images `E_{Q,R}(a(Y) | X)` of Q-model scores
    `a ∈ fullTangent` (the closure is genuine: the tangent *set* need not be
    closed, exactly as vdV states the theorem for the closure), and
  * `b ∈ coarseningScores hM P_full fullTangent` — a coarsening score,

with `p ⊥ b`. Both witnesses are constrained: `p` belongs to the closed observed
Q-score image and `b` to its orthogonal complement. This is the
orthogonal-decomposition theorem for the
closed subspace `(observedTangent …).topologicalClosure`; the identification of `p`
with a genuine `E(a(Y)|X)` and of `b` with a genuine `E_R(b|Y)=0` coarsening score
is delivered by the conditional-density bridge and the choice of
`fullTangent` as the Q-model tangent.

CAR does not appear as a hypothesis here: over the abstract `(P_full, M)` this is a
pure Hilbert-space decomposition. CAR is what makes `fullTangent` the Q-model
tangent and `coarseningScores` the `E_R(b|Y)=0` scores — that content lives in the
conditional layer (`ParametricFamily.CARScore`). -/
