# The conjugacy criterion (normalization principle)

The engine behind every conjugate-prior computation: **if the unnormalized posterior is a positive
finite multiple of a probability measure, the posterior IS that measure.**

* Pointwise: if `π.withDensity (p(·, x)) = c • ρ` with `c ∉ {0, ∞}` and `ρ` a probability
  measure, then `generalizedPosterior p π x = ρ` — no measurability, no almost-everywhere.
* A.e. lift: under a dominated model, if for every `x` the unnormalized posterior is `c(x) • ρ(x)`
  with each `ρ(x)` a probability measure, then `(κ†π) x = ρ x` for predictive-a.e. `x` — with
  **no side conditions on `c`**: evaluating at the whole space forces `c(x) = m(x)`, and Batch 1
  proves `0 < m < ∞` predictive-a.e.

**Reference.** C. P. Robert, *The Bayesian Choice: From Decision-Theoretic
Foundations to Computational Implementation*, 2nd ed., Springer Texts in Statistics, Springer,
2007 (ISBN 978-0-387-71598-8). §3.3.2, Definition 3.3.1 (conjugate families) and the
"proportionality" computations of §3.3–§4.2 that this lemma packages.

**Proof formalization notes.** Pointwise: apply the hypothesis to `Set.univ` to identify
`c = predictiveDensity p π x` (`withDensity_apply`, `setLIntegral_univ`, `Measure.smul_apply`,
`measure_univ`), then divide by `c` via `withDensity_smul'` (needs only `c⁻¹ ≠ ∞`) and cancel with
`ENNReal.inv_mul_cancel`. A.e. lift: `filter_upwards` with the Batch-1 headline
`posterior_eq_withDensity_likelihood_div_predictive` and `predictiveDensity_pos_ae` /
`predictiveDensity_lt_top_ae_comp`.

**Bibliographic comments.** "Recognize the posterior up to its normalizing constant" is the
working principle of every conjugate analysis since H. Raiffa and R. Schlaifer (*Applied
Statistical Decision Theory*, 1961); the posterior "is proportional to
f(x|θ)π(θ)" is its informal statement. Packaging it as a reusable measure-theoretic lemma is what
lets each conjugate pair below reduce to one pointwise density identity.
