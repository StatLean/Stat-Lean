# The prior predictive density and its regularity

For a dominated model `κ θ = ν.withDensity (p θ)` with prior `π`, this file establishes that the
data distribution has the prior predictive density `m` with respect to `ν`,
$$\kappa \circ_m \pi = \nu.\mathrm{withDensity}\,(m), \qquad m(x) = \int_\Theta p(\theta,x)\,\pi(d\theta),$$
together with the measurability of `m` and the a.e. non-degeneracy facts (`0 < m < ∞`) that hold
automatically under a finite model.

**Reference.** C. P. Robert, *The Bayesian Choice*, 2nd ed., Springer, 2007. §1.4, the marginal
`m(x) = ∫ f(x|θ) π(dθ)`, p. 22.

**Proof formalization notes.** `m`'s finiteness (`ν`-a.e. and `(κ ∘ₘ π)`-a.e.) and positivity
(`(κ ∘ₘ π)`-a.e.) are **derived** from `IsFiniteMeasure (κ ∘ₘ π)` and the withDensity
representation — they are *not* hypotheses (assuming `0 < m` would be laundering a fact forced by
the setup). Key Mathlib bricks: `Measurable.lintegral_prod_left'`, `Measure.bind_apply`,
`MeasureTheory.withDensity_apply`, `lintegral_eq_zero_iff`, `ae_lt_top`,
`withDensity_absolutelyContinuous`.
