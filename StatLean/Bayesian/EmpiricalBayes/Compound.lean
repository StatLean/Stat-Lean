# Compound decision problems and the oracle Bayes rule

The decision-theoretic frame for nonparametric empirical Bayes: with a mixing distribution `G`, the
oracle posterior is the ordinary generalized posterior of the likelihood against `G`, and the
oracle Bayes rule — which minimizes the posterior expected loss pointwise — minimizes the
**compound risk** (the loss integrated over the data marginal). Empirical Bayes approximates this
oracle by estimating `G` (or the marginal) from data.

**Reference.** Not in Robert (Robert §10.4.1 is the closest). H. Robbins, "Asymptotically subminimax
solutions of compound statistical decision problems," *Proc. Second Berkeley Symp.* (1951), 131–148;
B. Efron, *Large-Scale Inference*, Cambridge University Press, 2010, §1.

**Proof formalization notes.** `mixtureDensity_eq_predictiveDensity` and
`npEB_oraclePosterior_eq_withDensity` are the definitional bridges to the Batch-1/2 dominated-Bayes
machinery (`predictiveDensity`, `generalizedPosterior_def`, `bayesDensity`);
`oracleBayesRule_minimizes_compoundRisk` is `lintegral_mono` applied to a pointwise
posterior-risk domination — the pointwise Bayes optimality of the oracle rule integrates to
compound optimality.

**Bibliographic comments.** The compound decision problem and its empirical-Bayes solution are
Robbins's (1951, 1956); the "oracle" terminology and the modern large-scale reading are Efron's
(2010). The equivalence of pointwise (posterior) and compound (frequentist, integrated) Bayes
optimality is the decision-theoretic content of Fubini's theorem, as in Robert §2.3.
