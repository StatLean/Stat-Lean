# The iid product kernel `θ ↦ (κ θ)^{⊗ n}`

For a Markov kernel `κ : Kernel Θ 𝓧` and `n : ℕ`, the **iid kernel** sends a parameter `θ` to the
`n`-fold product of `κ θ` on `Fin n → 𝓧` — the law of an iid sample `x₁, …, xₙ` from the model
`f(·|θ)`. The key facts are measurability of `θ ↦ (κ θ)^{⊗ n}` (so the kernel exists), the Markov
property, and the **product-density representation**: if `κ θ = ν.withDensity (p θ)` then
$$\mathrm{iidKernel}\ \kappa\ n\ \theta = \nu^{\otimes n}.\mathrm{withDensity}
  \Big(x \mapsto \prod_i p(\theta, x_i)\Big).$$

(iid sampling model).

**Proof formalization notes.** The pinned Mathlib has no `Kernel.pi`; we package `Measure.pi`
directly. Measurability of the coe (`measurable_pi_const_kernel`) is by π-system induction on
boxes (`Measure.measurable_of_measurable_coe`, `Measure.pi_pi`, `Finset.measurable_prod` of
`Kernel.measurable_coe`); the Markov instance is `Measure.pi` of probability measures; the density
representation is `pi_withDensity` from `ForMathlib.PiWithDensity`. Restricted to
`[IsMarkovKernel κ]` (all Bayesian uses are Markov; it keeps the complement step of the induction
finite). Candidate for upstreaming.

**Bibliographic comments.** The iid product experiment is the basic object of sampling theory
since J. Bernoulli's *Ars Conjectandi* (1713); its kernel-parametrized form (a measurable family
of product measures) is the measure-theoretic folklore underlying Ionescu-Tulcea's and
Kolmogorov's constructions.
