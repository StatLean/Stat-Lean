# The Laplace (double-exponential) distribution `Laplace(0, b)`

The centered Laplace distribution with scale `b > 0`, a standard probability brick that the pinned
Mathlib lacks (it has the Gaussian and Gamma laws but not the double-exponential). Density
`f(x) = (2b)⁻¹ exp(−|x|/b)`, measure `Laplace(0, b) = volume.withDensity f`, and the symmetric-tail
identity `P(|X| > δ) = exp(−δ/b)` used to compute the Dirichlet–Laplace marginal tail.

**Reference.** Standard Laplace-distribution facts (e.g. Kotz–Kozubowski–Podgórski, *The Laplace
Distribution and Generalizations*, Birkhäuser, 2001, §2.1). A **standard Laplace-distribution brick**:
it carries no Dirichlet–Laplace-specific content of its own, but is consumed by the scale mixture
`θ | ψ ~ Laplace(ψ)`, `ψ ~ Gamma(a, 1/2)` of Bhattacharya–Pati–Pillai–Dunson, *Dirichlet–Laplace
priors for optimal shrinkage* (arXiv:1401.5398), eq. (10).

**Proof formalization notes.** `laplacePDFReal` keeps the raw prefactor `(2b)⁻¹`, so for `b ≤ 0` the
prefactor is `≤ 0` and `ENNReal.ofReal` collapses the density to `0`; hence `laplaceMeasure b = 0`
for `b ≤ 0` (a junk guard mirroring the Gaussian/Gamma conventions, keeping the object usable at
degenerate scale indices). The total-mass and tail computations reduce to `∫ exp(−x/b) dx` over a
half-line; the **tail identity** `laplaceMeasure b {δ < |x|} = exp(−δ/b)` is the Laplace
conditional-tail formula — the two symmetric exponential tails each contribute `(1/2)exp(−δ/b)`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The double-exponential law is Laplace's *first* law of errors (1774),
predating the Gaussian second law; in Bayesian shrinkage it is the prior behind the Bayesian lasso
(Park–Casella, *J. Amer. Statist. Assoc.* 103 (2008), 681–686).
