# The diagonal product kernel `θ ↦ ⊗ⱼ κ(θⱼ)`

For a Markov kernel `κ : Kernel α β` and `J : ℕ`, the **diagonal product kernel** sends a vector
`θ : Fin J → α` to the product measure `⊗ⱼ κ(θ_j)` on `Fin J → β` — the law of `J` independent
observations, the `j`-th drawn from `κ(θ_j)`. Unlike `iidKernel` (which applies the *same*
parameter to every coordinate), each coordinate here uses its own parameter `θ_j`. This is the
data kernel of the hierarchical normal model (`Y_j ∣ θ_j ∼ N(θ_j, σ²)` independently).

**Reference.** C. P. Robert, *The Bayesian Choice: From Decision-Theoretic
Foundations to Computational Implementation*, 2nd ed., Springer Texts in Statistics, Springer,
2007 (ISBN 978-0-387-71598-8). §10.2.5 (hierarchical extensions for the normal model), p. 470
(the per-coordinate sampling model of the one-way normal hierarchy).

**Proof formalization notes.** The pinned Mathlib has no `Kernel.pi`; we package `Measure.pi`
directly, exactly as `StatLean.Bayesian.iidKernel` does. Measurability of the coe is the same
π-system induction on boxes (`Measure.measurable_of_measurable_coe`, `Measure.pi_pi`,
`Finset.measurable_prod`), differing from the iid case only in the box step: each factor
`θ ↦ κ (θ j) (u j)` is `κ.measurable_coe` precomposed with the coordinate projection
`measurable_pi_apply j`. Restricted to `[IsMarkovKernel κ]` (all uses are Markov; keeps the
complement step finite). Candidate for upstreaming as the finite homogeneous-index `Kernel.pi`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The diagonal product of a measurable kernel family is the sampling
model behind the one-way random-effects (variance-components) analysis of C. Eisenhart ("The
assumptions underlying the analysis of variance," *Biometrics* 3 (1947), 1–21) and the compound
decision problems of H. Robbins (1951, 1956); it is the likelihood layer of Robert's normal
hierarchy (§10.2.5) and of the James–Stein / empirical-Bayes normal-means problem.
