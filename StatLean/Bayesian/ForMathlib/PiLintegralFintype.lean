# Finite-index (`Fintype`) products: Tonelli, densities, and subtype splits

`Fintype`-index upgrades of the `Fin n` product bricks in
`StatLean.Bayesian.ForMathlib.PiWithDensity`, together with the two subtype-split
lemmas that the Dirichlet–Laplace tensorization step (BPPD eq. (26)) needs.

* `lintegral_pi_prod_fintype` / `pi_withDensity_fintype` — the homogeneous
  `∫⁻ ∏ = ∏ ∫⁻` and `⨂ withDensity = withDensity ∏` identities over an arbitrary
  finite index `ι` (the `Fin n` versions lifted through `Fintype.equivFin`).
* `pi_map_restrict_subtype` — pushing a product of probability measures forward
  under the coordinate restriction `x ↦ x|_{S}` returns the product over the
  subtype `S = {i // p i}`; the complementary probability factors integrate out.
* `lintegral_pi_split` — split-Tonelli: an lintegral against `⨂_ι μ` becomes the
  iterated lintegral over the `p`-coordinates (outer) and the `¬p`-coordinates
  (inner), the point reassembled through `Equiv.piEquivPiSubtypeProd`.

**Reference.** Mathlib-level bricks (no book statement of their own) consumed by
the Dirichlet–Laplace posterior-contraction proof (Bhattacharya–Pati–Pillai–Dunson,
*Dirichlet–Laplace priors for optimal shrinkage*, JASA 2015 / arXiv:1401.5398;
tag `BPPD §X.Y`): they provide the product / subtype-split Tonelli used to
tensorize the posterior likelihood ratio into its `S₀ᶜ`-submodel factor
(BPPD eq. (26), §6).

**Proof formalization notes.** The two `_fintype` upgrades transport the `Fin n`
statements through `MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_piCongrLeft` along
`Fintype.equivFin`; `pi_map_restrict_subtype` composes
`MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_piEquivPiSubtypeProd` with the first-marginal
identity `MeasureTheory.Measure.map_fst_prod` (the `¬p` factor being a probability
measure); `lintegral_pi_split` is that same measure-preserving equivalence followed
by the product-measure Tonelli `MeasureTheory.lintegral_prod`. Candidate for
upstreaming; kept in the area `ForMathlib/` layer (namespace `StatLean.Bayesian`).

**Bibliographic comments.** Product measures and the Fubini–Tonelli theorem are
classical measure theory (Fubini 1907; Tonelli 1909), used here only in their
finite-product / iid-experiment form.
