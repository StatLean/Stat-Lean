# Rao–Blackwellization (variance reduction by conditioning)

Conditioning an estimator on a sub-σ-algebra cannot increase its quadratic risk:
$$\mathbb E\big[(\mathbb E[T \mid \mathcal G] - c)^2\big] \le \mathbb E\big[(T - c)^2\big].$$
In MCMC practice (`Robert §6.3.4`) this is the **Rao–Blackwellization** of an ergodic average:
replacing sampled values by their conditional expectations given the retained coordinates reduces
variance at no bias cost.

**Reference.** C. P. Robert, *The Bayesian Choice: From Decision-Theoretic
Foundations to Computational Implementation*, 2nd ed., Springer Texts in Statistics, Springer,
2007 (ISBN 978-0-387-71598-8). §6.3.4 (Rao–Blackwellization, displayed inequality, pp. 309–310 —
unnumbered; cites Gelfand and Smith 1990); the classical Rao–Blackwell theorem is the §2 exercise
tradition.

**Proof formalization notes.** Stretch item (2F.8). The route is L² contractivity of conditional
expectation: `eLpNorm_condExp_le : eLpNorm (μ[f|m]) 2 μ ≤ eLpNorm f 2 μ` applied to `f := T − c`
(`condExp_sub` and `condExp_const` move the constant through), then the `eLpNorm`-squared ↔
`∫⁻ sqLoss` bridge (`sqLoss c t = ‖t − c‖ₑ^2` up to symmetry of the square). If the exponent
bridging resists, this file's results are droppable without downstream impact (nothing consumes
them; recorded in the roadmap).

**Bibliographic comments.** The Rao–Blackwell theorem is C. R. Rao ("Information and the accuracy
attainable in the estimation of statistical parameters," *Bull. Calcutta Math. Soc.* 37 (1945),
81–91) and D. Blackwell ("Conditional expectation and unbiased sequential estimation," *Ann. Math.
Statist.* 18 (1947), 105–110). Its use as an MCMC variance-reduction device is A. E. Gelfand and
A. F. M. Smith (1990), extended by J. S. Liu, W. H. Wong and A. Kong ("Covariance structure of the
Gibbs sampler…," *Biometrika* 81 (1994), 27–40).
