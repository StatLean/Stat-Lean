# Model choice and testing — core data model

Data model for Bayesian testing, model comparison, and credible sets:

* `bayesFactorM` — the **Bayes factor between two models** as the ratio of marginal (predictive)
  densities, `B₀₁(x) = m₀(x)/m₁(x)`;
* `posteriorModelProb` — the **posterior probability of a model index** in a model-indexed
  experiment `Q : Kernel M 𝓧` with model prior `ϖ`;
* `hypLoss` — the asymmetric **`a₀–a₁` testing loss** for `H₀ : θ ∈ Θ₀`;
* `bayesTest` — the Bayes decision rule for that loss (accept `H₀` iff
  `a₁·π(Θ₀ᶜ|x) ≤ a₀·π(Θ₀|x)`, accepting on ties);
* `IsCredibleSet` — a family `C(x)` of parameter sets with posterior mass `≥ 1 − γ`.

**Reference.** C. P. Robert, *The Bayesian Choice: From Decision-Theoretic
Foundations to Computational Implementation*, 2nd ed., Springer Texts in Statistics, Springer,
2007 (ISBN 978-0-387-71598-8). §5.2.1, eq. (5.2.1) and Proposition 5.2.2 (the a₀–a₁ loss and its
Bayes rule), p. 225; §5.2.2, Definition 5.2.5 and eq. (5.2.2) (Bayes factor as marginal ratio),
p. 227; §7.2.1, eq. (7.2.2) (posterior model probabilities), p. 348; §5.5.1, Definition 5.5.2
(α-credible sets), p. 260.

**Proof formalization notes.** Laptop-only data model — definitions only. `bayesFactorM` is
distinct from the Batch-1 event-level `Cond.bayesFactor` (that one conditions two events of one
measure; this one compares two dominated models). `predictiveDensity` serves as Robert's marginal
`m(x)` for improper priors too, so no separate "marginal likelihood" name is introduced.
`posteriorModelProb` needs the model index to be standard Borel — automatic for the intended
finite/countable discrete `M`. `bayesTest` uses classical decidability of `≤` in `ℝ≥0∞` (the rule
is noncomputable, like every posterior quantity here).

**Bibliographic comments.** Bayes factors are due to H. Jeffreys (*Theory of Probability*, 1939),
the model-comparison calculus to §5–§7 of Robert; the modern review is R. E. Kass and A. E.
Raftery, "Bayes factors," *J. Amer. Statist. Assoc.* 90 (1995), 773–795. Posterior model
probabilities and model averaging in the form (7.2.2)–(7.2.3) were systematized in the 1990s
(A. E. Raftery, D. Madigan, J. A. Hoeting, "Bayesian model averaging for linear regression
models," *J. Amer. Statist. Assoc.* 92 (1997), 179–191). Credible regions are the Bayesian
counterpart of confidence sets; Robert Definition 5.5.2 follows the HPD tradition of Box and Tiao
(*Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis*, Addison-Wesley, 1973).
