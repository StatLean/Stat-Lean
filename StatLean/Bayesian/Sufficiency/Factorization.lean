# Factorized likelihoods: posterior reduction and the likelihood principle

Consequences of the Fisher–Neyman factorization `p(θ, x) = g(θ, T x) · h(x)` for a dominated
model:

* the base factor `h` **cancels from the posterior** — the posterior at `x` is the
  `g(·, T x)`-reweighted prior (Robert's "the factor h(x) disappears," §1.3.1);
* the **posterior depends on the data only through the sufficient statistic**:
  `(κ†π) x = ((statKernel κ T)†π) (T x)` for predictive-a.e. `x`;
* the **likelihood principle**, dominated version: proportional likelihoods (`p₁(·, x₁) =
  c · p₂(·, x₂)`) give equal posteriors under the same prior (Robert §1.3.2).

**Reference.** C. P. Robert, *The Bayesian Choice: From Decision-Theoretic
Foundations to Computational Implementation*, 2nd ed., Springer Texts in Statistics, Springer,
2007 (ISBN 978-0-387-71598-8). §1.3.1 (Definition 1.3.1 and the factorization theorem, p. 14);
§1.3.2 (the Likelihood Principle, stated as a boldface display, pp. 15–16, and the observation on
p. 16 that the posterior (1.2.3) depends on `x` only through the likelihood).

**Proof formalization notes.** The cancellation is `withDensity` algebra: at data with
`h(x) ∉ {0, ∞}` the ratio `p/m` equals `g/(∫ g dπ)` pointwise (`ENNReal.mul_div_mul_right`-style).
For the statistic reduction, the key bridge is `map_withDensity_comp` (a density factoring through
`T` passes through `Measure.map T`), which exhibits the statistic experiment as dominated by
`(ν.withDensity h).map T` with density `g`; both experiments' posteriors are then identified by the
Batch-1 dominated Bayes theorem, and the exceptional sets transport because `h ∈ (0, ∞)` holds
`(κ ∘ₘ π)`-a.e. (forced by `predictiveDensity_pos_ae`/`_lt_top_ae_comp` — not hypotheses). The
likelihood principle is the scalar case of the same cancellation.

**Bibliographic comments.** The Likelihood Principle was articulated by G. Barnard (1949) and
R. A. Fisher, given its modern form by A. Birnbaum ("On the foundations of statistical inference,"
*J. Amer. Statist. Assoc.* 57 (1962), 269–306 — Robert's Theorem 1.3.8: sufficiency +
conditionality ⇔ likelihood), and defended at book length by J. O. Berger and R. L. Wolpert,
*The Likelihood Principle* (IMS, 1988). That Bayesian inference automatically obeys it (the
posterior depends only on the likelihood) is Robert's observation on p. 16, formalized here.
