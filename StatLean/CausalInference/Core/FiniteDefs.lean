# Potential outcomes on a finite population — science tables and assignment designs

The design-based (finite-population, randomization-based) half of causal inference. The
science of the `n` units is a *fixed* table of two potential-outcome vectors; the only
randomness is the treatment assignment, described by an **assignment design**.

* `ScienceTable n` — the pair of potential-outcome vectors `Y(1), Y(0) : Fin n → ℝ`.
* `ScienceTable.observed S z` — the observed outcome vector `Yᵢ = ZᵢYᵢ(1) + (1-Zᵢ)Yᵢ(0)`.
* `ScienceTable.unitEffect`, `ScienceTable.finiteATE` — `τᵢ = Yᵢ(1) - Yᵢ(0)` and `τ = n⁻¹∑τᵢ`.
* `ScienceTable.SharpNull` — Fisher's sharp null `Yᵢ(1) = Yᵢ(0)` for every unit.
* `Design n` — an assignment mechanism: a nonempty finite set of assignment vectors,
  drawn **uniformly**. `Design.expect`, `Design.prob`, `Design.var` are the induced
  expectation, probability and variance.
* `completeDesign n n₁` — complete randomization: all vectors with exactly `n₁` treated.
* `armMean`, `diffInMeans`, `armVar`, `neymanVarEst` — the treated/control sample means,
  the difference-in-means estimator `τ̂`, the arm sample variances and Neyman's variance
  estimator `V̂ = ŝ²(1)/n₁ + ŝ²(0)/n₀`.
* `popMean`, `popVar`, `popCov` — the finite-population mean, variance `S²` and covariance
  (both normalized by `n - 1`, as in the book).
* `fisherPValue` — the randomization p-value of a statistic under a design.

**Scope.** Designs here are *uniform* on their support. Every design in the covered
chapters (complete randomization, stratified randomization, matched pairs) is of this
form, and uniformity is what makes the randomization test exact. Bernoulli designs with
`p ≠ 1/2` are out of scope.

(published by Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2024). §2.2–2.3 (potential outcomes, the observed
outcome equation (2.2), the average causal effect), Definition 3.1 (complete
randomization), §3.2 (the sharp null and the randomization p-value (3.2)), §4.1–4.2
(the difference in means, the finite-population variances `S²`, and Neyman's variance
estimator). (`Ding §2.2; §3.1–3.2; §4.1–4.2`.) The assignment-mechanism viewpoint —
a probability distribution over assignment vectors — is that of G. W. Imbens and
D. B. Rubin, *Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences*,
Cambridge University Press, 2015, Part II. (`IR Part II`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**

* A `Design` carries its support and a proof that the support is nonempty (constitutive:
  an assignment mechanism with no possible assignment is not a mechanism). Expectations
  are normalized `Finset` sums in `ℝ`; no measure theory is needed at this layer, and
  `Design.prob` uses `Set.indicator` so that no decidability instance is required.
* `popVar` and `popCov` divide by `n - 1`; for `n = 1` the divisor is `0` and Lean's
  junk value `0` results. The theorems that use them assume `2 ≤ n`.
* `armMean`/`armVar` divide by the realized arm size; on assignments where an arm is
  empty (or a singleton, for `armVar`) the junk value is `0`. The Neyman theorems
  restrict to `completeDesign` supports with `1 ≤ n₁ ≤ n - 1` (resp. `2 ≤ n₁ ≤ n - 2`),
  where the arms have the stated sizes.
* `completeDesign` needs `n₁ ≤ n` to have nonempty support; the witness is packaged as
  `completeSupport_nonempty`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The potential-outcome notation for randomized experiments is
J. Neyman's (1923, translated in *Statist. Sci.* **5** (1990), 465–472); its extension to
observational studies is D. B. Rubin, "Estimating causal effects of treatments in
randomized and nonrandomized studies," *J. Educ. Psychol.* **66** (1974), 688–701. The
randomization test is R. A. Fisher, *The Design of Experiments*, Oliver & Boyd, 1935.

vectors (Ding §2.2). Under SUTVA (Ding Assumptions 2.1–2.3) these are fixed numbers, so
the table is the complete "science" of the population; the assignment is the only source
of randomness. -/

can produce, and it must be nonempty. Uniformity on the support is part of the definition
at this layer — see the scope note in the module docstring. -/

    -- USER-INPUT: at most `n` units can be treated; Ding Definition 3.1
    (h : n₁ ≤ n) : (completeSupport n n₁).Nonempty := by
  sorry

uniform distribution on the `C(n, n₁)` assignment vectors with `n₁` ones
(Ding Definition 3.1). -/
noncomputable def completeDesign (n n₁ : ℕ) (h : n₁ ≤ n) : Design n :=
  ⟨completeSupport n n₁, completeSupport_nonempty h⟩

arm is empty. -/

/-! ### Randomization inference -/

/-- The **randomization p-value** of the statistic value function `g` at the realized
assignment `z` (Ding eq. (3.2)): the design probability that a re-randomized assignment
gives a statistic value at least as large as the realized one.

Here `g z' = T(z', Y^obs)` is the statistic recomputed at the hypothetical assignment `z'`
with the observed outcome vector held fixed — under the sharp null the outcome vector does
not depend on the assignment, which is exactly what makes `g` well defined. -/
