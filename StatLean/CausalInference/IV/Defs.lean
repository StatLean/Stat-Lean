# Instrumental variables — potential treatments, compliance types, and the IV assumptions

Data model for noncompliance: a binary instrument `Z` (the *assigned* treatment), the pair
of potential treatments `D(1), D(0)` (what the unit would actually take under each
assignment), and the potential outcomes `Y(1), Y(0)` indexed by the assignment. Each unit
falls into one of four **compliance types** determined by `(D(1), D(0))`:

| `D(1)` | `D(0)` | type |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | always taker |
| 1 | 0 | complier |
| 0 | 1 | defier |
| 0 | 0 | never taker |

The three IV assumptions — random assignment, monotonicity (no defiers) and the exclusion
restriction — are separate predicates, as they are separately falsifiable and separately
used.

(published by Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2024). §21.2.1 (p. 282: the four compliance types);
Assumption 21.1 (p. 282: `Z ⫫ {D(1), D(0), Y(1), Y(0)}`); Assumption 21.2 (p. 283:
monotonicity `Dᵢ(1) ≥ Dᵢ(0)`, i.e. no defiers); Assumption 21.3 (p. 283: the exclusion
restriction `Yᵢ(1) = Yᵢ(0)` for always takers and never takers); Definition 21.1 (p. 284:
the complier average causal effect). (`Ding §21.2; Assumptions 21.1–21.3;
Definition 21.1`.) The noncompliance framework is developed at length in G. W. Imbens and
D. B. Rubin, *Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences*,
Cambridge University Press, 2015, chs. 23–25. (`IR chs. 23–25`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**

* Potential outcomes are indexed by the **instrument**, `Y(z)`, not by the pair `(z, d)`.
  This is Ding's ch. 21 convention, and it is what makes the exclusion restriction
  statable as `Y(1) = Y(0)` on the non-compliers rather than as a functional-form
  restriction. The `Y(z, d)` formulation is not needed for any result in this release.
* The exclusion restriction is stated **pointwise** (`∀ ω, D(1) ω = D(0) ω → Y(1) ω =
  Y(0) ω`), which is the book's individual-level assumption; the weaker in-mean version
  would not support the mixture decompositions.
* `complianceType` is total: every unit has a type, so the four types partition the sample
  space by construction — the content of `complianceType_partition` is that these four
  events are disjoint and exhaust, which is then available for the mixture arguments.
