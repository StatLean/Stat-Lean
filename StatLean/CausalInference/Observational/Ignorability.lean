# Unconfoundedness — what it buys inside a covariate cell

The bridge between the assumption `{Y(1), Y(0)} ⫫ Z | X` and the identification formulas:
inside a covariate cell, the conditional mean of a potential outcome does not depend on
which arm one conditions on, i.e. **the arm regression function recovers the potential
outcome mean**,

$$m_z(x)=\mathbb E[Y\mid Z=z,X=x]=\mathbb E[Y(z)\mid X=x].$$

This is the only place where independence is used; every later identification theorem
(standardization, IPW, AIPW, ATT) consumes this file's conclusions.

(published by Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2024). Assumption 10.1 (ignorability `Y(z) ⫫ Z | X`,
eq. (10.10)), Assumption 10.2 (strong ignorability `{Y(1),Y(0)} ⫫ Z | X`, eq. (10.11)),
and eqs. (10.3)–(10.4) (the mean-ignorability hypotheses of Theorem 10.1).
(`Ding Assumptions 10.1–10.2; §10.3`.) The unconfoundedness terminology and its role in
observational studies is that of G. W. Imbens and D. B. Rubin, *Causal Inference for
Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences*, Cambridge University Press, 2015, Part III.
(`IR Part III`.)

**Proof formalization notes.** With a discrete covariate, `Unconfounded` is cell-wise
independence under `μ[|{X = x}]` (see `Core.PopulationDefs`), so each result here is
`ForMathlib.CondAlgebra.integral_cond_arm_eq_of_indepFun` applied inside a cell, after
rewriting `μ[|{Z = z} ∩ {X = x}]` as `(μ[|{X = x}])[|{Z = z}]` — that rewriting
(`cond_cond_eq_cond_inter`) is the first lemma below. Observed outcomes agree with the
relevant potential outcome on each arm, which is what lets `cellMean` of the *observed*
outcome be replaced by a potential-outcome mean.

**Bibliographic comments.** P. R. Rosenbaum and D. B. Rubin, "The central role of the
propensity score in observational studies for causal effects," *Biometrika* **70** (1983),
41–55, introduce strong ignorability.

/-! ### Private infrastructure

Two bricks carrying the measurability that the headline statements below supply.

* `cond_armCell_eq'` is the arm-cell instance of "conditioning twice is conditioning on the
  intersection". It is proved *by hand* rather than through `cond_cond_eq_cond_inter`
  because only the **arm** `{Z = z}` is known to be measurable here: the covariate cell
  `X ⁻¹' {x}` is not, `𝒳` carrying no `MeasurableSingletonClass`. Measurability of the arm
  is exactly what `Measure.restrict_restrict` and `Measure.restrict_apply` need, so the
  covariate cell never has to be measurable; the scalars then telescope because the cell
  has finite, nonzero mass.
* `cellMean_obs_eq'` is `cellMean_obs_eq` with `Measurable Z` supplied. The arm cell itself
  need not be measurable: it is a subset of the measurable arm, so `μ.restrict (armCell)`
  is dominated by `μ.restrict {Z = z}` and a.e. membership transfers. -/
