# Matching — exact matching, and the bias of inexact matches

Matching imputes each treated unit's missing control outcome by the outcome of a matched
control. Two facts govern its behaviour.

* **Exact matching balances the covariate**, so the imputation is unbiased: if the matched
  control has the *same* covariate value, its expected outcome is the same regression
  function `m₀(x)`.
* **Inexact matching leaves a bias** equal to the discrepancy of the control regression
  function between the two covariate values, `m₀(Xᵢ) - m₀(X_{j(i)})`. If `m₀` is
  `L`-Lipschitz this is at most `L·d(Xᵢ, X_{j(i)})` — so the bias is controlled by the
  match quality, which is the entire justification for bias-corrected matching.

**Scope.** Formalized here are the **population/estimand-level** statements: exact matching
recovers the control regression function, and the inexact-matching bias equals the `m₀`
discrepancy and is Lipschitz-controlled. The finite-sample matching estimator with `M`
nearest neighbours, its bias-corrected version and Propositions 15.1–15.4 are *estimation*
results whose content is the asymptotic behaviour of the matching discrepancy; they are out
of scope for this release, which stops at identification.

**Proof formalization notes.** A matching is a map `j : Ω → Ω` sending each unit to its
matched partner (`matchedControl`); exactness is `X (j ω) = X ω`. The unbiasedness
statement is then a direct corollary of `Ignorability`'s cell-mean bridge: the matched
partner is drawn from the same covariate cell, whose control arm has mean `m₀(x)`. The
Lipschitz bound is a pointwise estimate with no probabilistic content — it is stated over a
`PseudoMetricSpace` covariate so that "match quality" has a meaning.

treatment effects," *Econometrica* **74** (2006), 235–267, and "Bias-corrected matching

Three bricks. The first two turn the *real-valued* overlap hypothesis `Positive` into the
*measure-valued* arm-nonnullity hypotheses that `Ignorability`'s cell-mean bridges ask for
— on a cell of positive mass, `e(x) < 1` says exactly that the control arm of that cell is
not null. The third is the ignorability step for the **control** potential outcome inside
the **treated** arm of a cell, which is what makes the treated average of the imputed
control means equal the treated average of `Y(0)`; it is the arm-cell independence
argument, reassembled here from the public `cond_armCell_eq` and
`integral_cond_arm_eq_of_indepFun`. -/
