# The propensity score — balancing and dimension reduction

The propensity score `e(x) = P(Z = 1 | X = x)` is a **balancing score**: conditioning on it
alone makes the treatment probability constant across covariate values,

$$\Pr(Z=1\mid X=x)=\Pr\bigl(Z=1\mid e(X)=e(x)\bigr),$$

and under ignorability it suffices to adjust for `e(X)` instead of the full covariate —
the dimension-reduction property that makes propensity-score methods practical. This file
also proves the weighted-balance identity `E[Z h(X)/e(X)] = E[(1-Z) h(X)/(1-e(X))]` that
underlies weighting diagnostics.

(published by Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2024). Definition 11.1 (the propensity score, p. 153);
Theorem 11.3 (§11.3.1, p. 163: `Z ⫫ X | e(X)`, which needs *no* ignorability assumption,
together with the weighted balance eq. (11.2)); Theorem 11.1 (§11.1.1, p. 154: strong
ignorability given `X` implies strong ignorability given `e(X)`); §11.2.1 for
overlap. (`Ding Definition 11.1; Theorems 11.1, 11.3`.) Propensity-score design in

Sciences*, Cambridge University Press, 2015, chs. 12–13. (`IR chs. 12–13`.)

**Scope.** Ding's Theorem 11.1 is stated as a conditional *independence*
`{Y(1),Y(0)} ⫫ Z | e(X)`. What is formalized here is its **mean form**
(`integral_cond_propensityLevel_arm_eq`): within a level set of the propensity score, the
arm-conditional mean of a potential outcome equals its unconditional mean. That is the
form every downstream identification result consumes, and it avoids building a
conditional-independence-given-a-real-valued-statistic layer that StatLean does not have.

**Proof formalization notes.** `propensityLevel μ Z X v` is the preimage `{e(X) = v}`, a
finite union of covariate cells because `𝒳` is finite. Both balancing results reduce to:
each cell in the level set has treatment probability exactly `v`, so the mixture over
cells also has treatment probability `v`. The weighted-balance identity is a cell-wise
computation in which the factor `e(x)` cancels.

/-! ### Private infrastructure

A propensity level `{e(X) = v}` is a **union of covariate cells**: membership depends on
`ω` only through `X ω`. That regrouping (`propensityLevel_inter_cell_eq` and
`propensityLevel_inter_cell_empty`, used inside the cell decomposition of an arbitrary
measurable set) is what every result below rests on. Two consequences are isolated: the
mass of the treated part of a level is `v` times the mass of the level
(`measureReal_treated_inter_propensityLevel`), and — under unconfoundedness — so is the
integral of a potential outcome over it (`setIntegral_treated_inter_propensityLevel`). The
level set is measurable because `e ∘ X` is a measurable function into `ℝ`, `𝒳` being
discrete. -/
