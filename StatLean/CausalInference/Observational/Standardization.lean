# Standardization — identification of the average causal effect by outcome regression

The first identification theorem of observational causal inference. Under (mean)
ignorability and positivity, the mean potential outcome is the covariate-standardized
average of the arm regression function,

$$\mathbb E[Y(z)]=\sum_x \Pr(X=x)\,m_z(x),\qquad
  \tau=\sum_x \Pr(X=x)\,\bigl(m_1(x)-m_0(x)\bigr),$$

which is Ding's eq. (10.8) — the *g-formula* for a point treatment.

**Reference.** P. Ding, *A First Course in Causal Inference*, arXiv:2305.18793v2, 2023
(published by Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2024). Theorem 10.1 (§10.3.1, p. 144) with its
hypotheses eqs. (10.3)–(10.4) (mean ignorability), conclusion eqs. (10.5)–(10.7), and the
discrete-covariate form eq. (10.8); Definition 10.1 (identification, p. 143); the
overlap/positivity condition of §11.2.1. (`Ding Theorem 10.1; §10.3.1; §11.2.1`.) See
also G. W. Imbens and D. B. Rubin, *Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and
Biomedical Sciences*, Cambridge University Press, 2015, Part III. (`IR Part III`.)

**Proof formalization notes.** With a discrete covariate the proof is: decompose the
integral over covariate cells (`integral_eq_sum_cell`), replace each within-cell mean of
the potential outcome by the arm regression function
(`cellMean_true_eq_of_unconfounded`), and recombine. Positivity is what makes both arm
regression functions well defined in every cell that carries mass; on null cells both
sides contribute `0` and no hypothesis is needed. The theorem is stated under
`Unconfounded` (Ding Assumption 10.2) rather than the weaker mean-ignorability hypothesis
because the cell-mean bridge is proved from independence; a mean-ignorability version is
recorded separately as `ate_eq_sum_cellMean_of_meanIgnorable`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The formula is J. M. Robins's g-computation formula for a
point exposure, "A new approach to causal inference in mortality studies with a sustained
exposure period," *Math. Modelling* **7** (1986), 1393–1512; the standardization
terminology is standard in epidemiology.
