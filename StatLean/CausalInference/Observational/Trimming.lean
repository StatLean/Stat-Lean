# Overlap and trimming — bounded weights, and the estimand you actually get

Limited overlap is the practical failure mode of weighting: as `e(X)` approaches `0` or
`1` the inverse-probability weights explode. Two responses, and their consequences:

* **Strict overlap** `η ≤ e(X) ≤ 1 - η` bounds every weight by `1/η`, which is what makes
  weighting estimators stable.
* **Trimming** — discarding units outside a propensity range — restores stability but
  **changes the estimand**: what is identified afterwards is the average causal effect
  *over the retained subpopulation*, not `τ`. The overlap-weighted estimand `τ_O` is the
  smooth version of the same idea.

**Reference.** P. Ding, *A First Course in Causal Inference*, arXiv:2305.18793v2, 2023
(published by Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2024). §11.2.3 (pp. 160–161: the strong overlap condition
`0 < α_L ≤ e(X) ≤ α_U < 1`, stated as an unlabeled display, and the weight blow-up with
truncation/trimming as remedies); ch. 20 (*Overlap in Observational Studies*),
**Assumption 20.1** (§20.1, p. 267: strict overlap `η ≤ e(X) ≤ 1 - η`, `η ∈ (0, 1/2)`);
**Theorem 13.4** and its table (p. 188: the `h`-weighted estimands, whose overlap row is
`h(X) = e(X){1 - e(X)}`, giving
`τ_O = E[e(1-e)τ(X)]/E[e(1-e)]`, with the noted reduction to `τ` when `τ(X)` is constant).
(`Ding §11.2.3; Assumption 20.1; Theorem 13.4`.) Assessing overlap and trimming are chs. 14
and 16 of G. W. Imbens and D. B. Rubin, *Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and
Biomedical Sciences*, Cambridge University Press, 2015. (`IR chs. 14, 16`.)

**Scope.** That "trimming changes the estimand" is **prose** in both references (Ding
§11.2.3 p. 161 and §20.1.1 p. 268 discuss it and cite Crump et al. (2009) and Yang–Ding
(2018) rather than proving an in-book theorem). What is formalized here is the precise
version of that statement: the trimmed identification formula equals the average causal
effect *conditional on the retained set* (`trimmedEstimand_eq_cate_of_trimmedSet`), which
differs from `τ` unless the conditional effect is constant. Ding's **Theorem 20.1** (the
covariate-imbalance bound under strict overlap) is not formalized: it depends on
distributional constants imported from D'Amour et al. (2021) that the book does not develop.

**Proof formalization notes.** The trimmed population is the union of the covariate cells
whose propensity lies in `[η, 1-η]`; conditioning on it is `ProbabilityTheory.cond` on that
union, so the "changed estimand" statement is an application of
`Standardization.ate_eq_sum_cate` restricted to those cells. The weight bounds are pointwise
arithmetic from `StronglyOverlapping`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The optimal trimming rule is R. K. Crump, V. J. Hotz,

treatment effects," *Biometrika* **96** (2009), 187–199; overlap weights are F. Li,

/-! ### Private infrastructure

Three bricks, all about *functions of the covariate*. A function `g : 𝒳 → ℝ` composed with
`X` is automatically measurable and bounded (`𝒳` is finite), hence integrable against any
finite measure; and inside a covariate cell of positive mass it is a.e. constant, so it
factors out of the conditional integral. The third brick is the partition statement:
`trimmedSet` is the union of the retained cells, which is what turns the trimmed integral
into a finite sum. -/
