# The Fisher randomization test — finite-sample validity

Under the sharp null every potential outcome is known once the experiment is run, so the
statistic can be recomputed at every assignment the design could have produced. The
resulting p-value

$$p(z)=\Pr_{Z^\ast}\bigl\{T(Z^\ast)\ge T(z)\bigr\}$$

is **super-uniform** under any design: `Pr(p ≤ α) ≤ α` for every `α ≥ 0`. This is exact in
finite samples and needs no distributional assumption whatsoever — only that the design
draws uniformly from its support.

**Reference.** P. Ding, *A First Course in Causal Inference*, arXiv:2305.18793v2, 2023
(published by Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2024). §3.2: the sharp null hypothesis
`H₀ : Yᵢ(1) = Yᵢ(0)` for all `i`, the randomization p-value eq. (3.2), and the validity
statement eq. (3.3) `Pr(p ≤ u) ≤ u` (stated as a display; the proof is left as Problem
3.1). (`Ding §3.2, eqs. (3.2)–(3.3)`.) The same test is developed in G. W. Imbens and
D. B. Rubin, *Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences*,
Cambridge University Press, 2015, ch. 5. (`IR ch. 5`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**

* Validity is proved for an **arbitrary design** and an arbitrary real-valued function `g`
  of the assignment, which is stronger and simpler than the CRE-only statement: the
  argument is that `{z | p(z) ≤ α}` is an upper set for `g`, so it is contained in
  `{z | g z₀ ≤ g z}` for a `g`-minimal element `z₀` of it, and that set has probability
  exactly `p(z₀) ≤ α`. Stratified and matched-pair designs therefore inherit validity with
  no extra work.
* `0 ≤ α` is genuinely needed: for `α < 0` the event is empty and the claim would read
  `0 ≤ α`.
* The sharp null enters only through `SharpNull.observed_eq`: it makes the observed
  outcome vector — and hence the statistic value function `g` — independent of which
  assignment was realized. That step is isolated in `sharpNull_statistic_eq`.
* StatLean already has a measure-theoretic randomization test for group-invariant laws
  (`StatLean.HypothesisTesting.superUniform_randPValue`, over a `MulAction` of a finite
  group). This file is the *design-based* counterpart on a finite population; it is
  deliberately independent of that concept-layer development.
