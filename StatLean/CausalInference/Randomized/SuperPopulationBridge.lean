# From the finite population to the superpopulation

The two frameworks are reconciled by treating the `n` units as an i.i.d. sample from a
superpopulation: the finite-population average causal effect of the sampled units is then
itself a random variable, unbiased for the superpopulation effect and converging to it,

$$\mathbb E\Bigl[\frac1n\sum_{i<n}\{Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)\}\Bigr]=\tau,
\qquad
\frac1n\sum_{i<n}\{Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)\}\ \xrightarrow{\ \text{a.s.}\ }\ \tau .$$

So a design-based analysis of a sampled finite population is automatically an analysis of
the superpopulation estimand.

(published by Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2024). ch. 9, Definition 9.3 (§9.1, p. 130: the CRE under
the superpopulation framework, with `{Zᵢ, Yᵢ(1), Yᵢ(0), Xᵢ}` i.i.d. and
`Z ⫫ {Y(1),Y(0),X}`) and eq. (9.1) (`τ = E(Y|Z=1) - E(Y|Z=0)`); §9.1–9.2 (p. 131:
the conditional moments given the assignment vector, stated as unnumbered displays).
(`Ding ch. 9; Definition 9.3; eq. (9.1)`.) The corresponding discussion is in
G. W. Imbens and D. B. Rubin, *Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical
Sciences*, Cambridge University Press, 2015, ch. 6. (`IR ch. 6`.)

**Scope.** The two-level (sampling × assignment) variance decomposition is **not**
formalized: it is not a numbered result in Ding's ch. 9 (he works directly in the i.i.d.
superpopulation), and stating it faithfully would require a joint model of the sampling
mechanism and the design that neither reference text sets up. What is formalized is the
part Ding does state: unbiasedness and convergence of the sampled finite-population
effect, plus the identification identity eq. (9.1) — the latter is
`SelectionBias.primaFacie_eq_ate_of_indep`, proved there in exactly Definition 9.3's
independence form.

**Proof formalization notes.** Unbiasedness is linearity of the integral plus
`IdentDistrib.integral_eq`; convergence is Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.strong_law_ae_real`
applied to the individual-effect sequence `Wᵢ = Yᵢ(1) - Yᵢ(0)`, whose pairwise
independence and identical distribution are inherited from the sampled units. The
hypotheses are stated on `W` directly rather than on the pair `(Y(1), Y(0))` so that the
Mathlib lemma applies verbatim; deriving them from independence of the *pairs* is a
routine `IndepFun.comp` step recorded as `indepFun_unitEffect`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The finite-population/superpopulation bridge for causal
inference is developed in P. Ding, X. Li and L. W. Miratrix, "Bridging finite and super
population causal inference," *J. Causal Inference* **5** (2017), 20160027.
