# The E-value — how strong must unmeasured confounding be?

Cornfield's inequality bounds the *observed* risk ratio by a function of the two
confounding risk ratios: if an unmeasured binary confounder `U` fully explains an observed
association, then

$$\mathrm{RR}^{\mathrm{obs}}\ \le\
  \frac{\mathrm{RR}_{ZU}\,\mathrm{RR}_{UY}}{\mathrm{RR}_{ZU}+\mathrm{RR}_{UY}-1}
  \;=\;\beta(\mathrm{RR}_{ZU},\mathrm{RR}_{UY}).$$

Inverting this bound gives the **E-value**
`E = RR + √(RR(RR-1))`: to explain away an observed risk ratio `RR`, the *larger* of the two
confounding associations must be at least `E`. It is a one-number summary of how fragile a
causal claim is.

**Scope.** This file formalizes the **algebra** of the bound: the properties of `β`, the
sharp threshold, and the E-value's defining inversion property. The probabilistic
derivation of Theorem 17.1 from a latent-ignorability model (Ding's eq. (17.2)) is *not*
formalized in this release: it needs the confounded-observational-model layer that the
`Rosenbaum` and `Observational` files build for other purposes, and its content is the
inequality that we take as the starting point here. What *is* proved is exactly the part a
practitioner uses — that `E` is the least value of `max(RR_ZU, RR_UY)` compatible with a
given observed risk ratio.

**Proof formalization notes.** All statements are about real numbers under
`1 ≤ w₁, w₂` and `1 ≤ RR`, so they are `nlinarith`/`field_simp`-shaped once the right
auxiliary square is supplied. The key identity behind the E-value is that
`β(E, E) = E²/(2E-1) = RR` exactly when `E = RR + √(RR(RR-1))`, i.e. `E` is the root of
`E² - 2·RR·E + RR = 0` that is `≥ 1`; the discriminant is `4RR(RR-1) ≥ 0` precisely
because `RR ≥ 1`.
