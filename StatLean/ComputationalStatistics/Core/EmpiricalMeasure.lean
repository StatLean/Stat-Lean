# Empirical, weighted and categorical measures: basic identities

The finite-sum/measure conversions every later module reduces to:

* `isProbabilityMeasure_empiricalMeasure` — `(1/n)·Σᵢ δ_{xᵢ}` is a probability
  measure for `n ≥ 1`;
* `integral_empiricalMeasure` — `∫ f d𝔽ₙ = (1/n)·Σᵢ f(xᵢ)` (`= mcEstimate f x`);
* `isProbabilityMeasure_weightedMeasure`, `integral_weightedMeasure` — the
  weighted analogues under simplex weights;
* `integral_categorical`, `weightedMeasure_eq_map_categorical`,
  `empiricalMeasure_eq_map_categorical` — a weighted sample is the pushforward
  of a categorical index draw through the data; the empirical measure is the
  uniform-weights case.

**Reference.** James E. Gentle, *Elements of Computational Statistics*, Springer,
2002 (ISBN 0-387-95489-9), §2.5 (random sampling from data: "the discrete uniform
population defined by the data"), ch. 4 p. 83–84 (the ECDF as a population).
(`ECS §X.Y`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**

* Integrals against Dirac sums need strong measurability of the integrand
  (`MeasureTheory.integral_dirac'`); these are LEAN-ONLY hypotheses.
* `empiricalMeasure_apply` is stated for measurable sets in `ℝ≥0∞` count form
  `(1/n)·#{i | xᵢ ∈ s}`.
* The pushforward lemmas need no measurability hypothesis on `x` because
  `Fin m` is discrete (`Measurable.of_discrete`).

**Bibliographic comments.** Viewing the sample as a surrogate population is
Efron (1979); the identities here are folklore.
