# Marginals of i.i.d. product measures along coordinate deletion

Deleting one coordinate from an i.i.d. product sample leaves an i.i.d. product
sample of the smaller size:

* `pi_map_precomp_succAbove` — the pushforward of `P^{n+1}` under
  `x ↦ x ∘ Fin.succAbove i` is `P^n`;
* `pi_map_deleteSplit` — `x ↦ (x i, x ∘ Fin.succAbove i)` carries `P^{n+1}` to
  `P ⊗ P^n` (the deleted coordinate is independent of the rest).

These are the measure-theoretic content of the jackknife ("the deleted sample
is again a random sample", ECS §3.3) and of cross-validation fold splitting
("the test fold is independent of the training folds", ECS §3.2).

**Reference.** James E. Gentle, *Elements of Computational Statistics*, Springer,
2002 (ISBN 0-387-95489-9), §3.2–§3.3 (implicit in the jackknife and data
partitioning setups).  (`ECS §3.2–3.3`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**

* Constant factors only (`fun _ => P`); the general non-identical version is
  not needed by any consumer and is deferred.
* Expected route: Mathlib's `MeasurableEquiv.piFinSuccAbove` and the
  measure-preservation of the corresponding equivalence on `Measure.pi`,
  then project.  Candidate pinned-Mathlib bricks:
  `MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_piFinSuccAbove`, `Measure.pi_map_eval`.

**Bibliographic comments.** Folklore; recorded because Quenouille (1949) and
Tukey (1958) use it silently in every jackknife computation.
