# Holdout validation

The basic correctness statement of data partitioning (ECS §3.2): a test set
that is independent of the training data gives an unbiased estimate of the
prediction risk of the *trained* rule — not of the full-sample rule, which is
the standard overclaim this file deliberately avoids.

* `predictionRisk` — `R(h) = ∫ ℓ(h, z) dD(z)`;
* `holdout_unbiased` — for a *fixed* trained hypothesis (equivalently:
  conditionally on the training data), the test-sample average loss has
  expectation `R(h)` (ECS §3.2, eq. (3.2));
* `holdout_integrated` — the tower version over a random training sample:
  `E_{S,T}[holdout] = E_S[R(A(S))]`.

**Reference.** James E. Gentle, *Elements of Computational Statistics*, Springer,
2002 (ISBN 0-387-95489-9), §3.2 (cross validation for smoothing and fitting:
the training/validation split, eqs. (3.1)–(3.2), and the warning that the
apparent error (3.1) is optimistic).  (`ECS §3.2`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**

* "Conditionally on the training data" is formalized by making the trained
  hypothesis a parameter: `holdout_unbiased` holds for every `h`, hence for
  `h = A(s)` at every training outcome `s`; the conditional-expectation
  phrasing adds nothing at this layer and is deferred.
* `predictionRisk` deliberately coexists with
  `StatLean.StatisticalLearning.risk` (concept layer of another area, not
  importable here); the SSBD-side single-fresh-point analogue of
  `holdout_integrated` is `integral_loss_fresh_eq_integral_risk` there.
* `[NeZero k]` excludes the empty test set (junk average `0`).

**Bibliographic comments.** Training/validation splitting is folklore going
back at least to Larson (1931); the modern account follows M. Stone,
"Cross-validatory choice and assessment of statistical predictions," *J. Roy.
Statist. Soc. B* **36** (1974), 111–147.
