# K-fold and leave-one-out cross validation

The fold estimators of ECS §3.2 and the correct basic theorem about them:
cross validation is unbiased **for the expected risk of the rule trained on
one fold less** — not for the risk of the full-sample rule (that statement is
generally false, and is deliberately not made).

* `kFoldEstimate` — data as `K + 1` folds of size `m`; each fold is held out
  once against the rule trained on the remaining `K` folds (deletion is the
  jackknife's `Fin.succAbove`);
* `kFold_unbiased` — `E[CV] = E_{S ~ D^{K·m}}[R(A(S))]`;
* `looEstimate`, `loo_unbiased` — leave-one-out (`m = 1` in spirit; stated
  directly over `Fin (n+1)` observations); Allen's PRESS (ECS eq. (3.4)) is
  `looEstimate` with squared-error loss.

**Reference.** James E. Gentle, *Elements of Computational Statistics*, Springer,
2002 (ISBN 0-387-95489-9), §3.2 (K-fold cross validation, pp. 72–73; PRESS,
eq. (3.4)).  (`ECS §3.2`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**

* Fold structure is a *matrix* `z : Fin (K+1) → Fin m → Z` (folds ×
  observations), so fold deletion is `jackknifeDelete` at the outer index and
  no `n/K` divisibility bookkeeping ever appears; the flat-sample version is
  recoverable through the `Fin (K+1) × Fin m ≃ Fin ((K+1)·m)` reindexing and
  is deferred.
* The probabilistic step is `pi_map_deleteSplit` (the held-out fold is
  independent of the training folds); each of the `K + 1` summands then has
  the same expectation, by exchangeability of the folds.
* The training set of each fold has size `K·m`, so the theorem compares CV to
  the risk of the *reduced-size* rule — the honest statement (Stone 1974).

/-- The common measure-theoretic core of `loo_unbiased` and `kFold_unbiased`: for a
score `F` of a (training block, held-out block) pair, the delete-one average of
`F` over a `Q^{N+1}` sample has the product-measure expectation.  Deleting the
`i`-th block carries `Q^{N+1}` to `Q^N ⊗ Q` (`pi_map_deleteSplit` composed with
`Prod.swap`), so every one of the `N + 1` summands has the same integral. -/
