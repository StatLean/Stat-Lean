# Separable versions of a real-valued process

The version-selection layer for genuine `sup_{t ∈ T}` chaining statements
over an uncountable index set: `IsSeparableProcess X T μ` says some countable
`T₀ ⊆ T` a.s. captures every value `X t ω`, `t ∈ T`, in the closure of the
`T₀`-values. Constructors: any countable `T` (sure, not just a.e.), and a.e.
sample-path continuity on a topologically separable index set (with
`isSeparable_of_coveringNumber_ne_top` supplying separability from the
Dudley covering package). Transport lemmas convert the a.s. value-closure
into a.e. equalities of composed suprema over `T` and over the countable
witness — in `ℝ≥0∞` (single and pair form, lower-semicontinuous shapes) and
in `ℝ` (nonnegative continuous shapes) — plus the pointwise threshold bridge
`exists_lt_comp_of_mem_closure` used by the tail forms.

**Reference.** Roman Vershynin, *High-Dimensional Probability*, 2nd ed.,
Cambridge University Press, p. 227 footnote ("we are assuming T is finite to
avoid measurability issues; the general case typically follows by
approximation") and Remark 7.2.1 — this file is the approximation, in the
form standard in the rigorous chaining literature (separable versions).

**Proof formalization notes.** The definition is **value-space** (Doob-style)
separability: no metric on the index type is needed, and it is weaker (hence
the theorems are stronger) than metric-dense-subset separability. It is a
genuine USER-INPUT: modifying each `X t` on a `t`-dependent null set
preserves `SubGaussianIncrements` (a per-pair a.e. condition) but can make
`sup_{t∈T} X t ≡ ∞` for uncountable `T`, so the hypothesis is
mathematically REQUIRED for any uncountable-sup statement and cannot be
derived. Edge behavior: for `T = ∅` the witness `T₀ = ∅` works vacuously;
for `T ≠ ∅` every witness is automatically nonempty (`closure ∅ = ∅`). The
`ℝ≥0∞` transport is stated for lower-semicontinuous shapes so that the pair
form can feed the countable sup of continuous shapes back through it; the
real transport carries a nonnegativity hypothesis `hφ0` — WITHOUT it the
equality is false at `T = Set.univ` with all-negative values (the `T`-side
supremum has no `Real.sSup ∅ = 0` junk branch while the `C`-side does).
Named-sorry fallback of this work item: the real transport
`biSup_real_comp_eq_of_forall_mem_closure`.

**Bibliographic comments.** Separable versions go back to J. L. Doob,
*Stochastic Processes*, Wiley 1953, Ch. II; the modern treatment for
chaining is R. van Handel, *Probability in High Dimension* (APC 550 notes,
Princeton, 2016), §5.3, and M. Talagrand, *Upper and Lower Bounds for
Stochastic Processes*, Springer 2014, §2.2.

/-- **Separable version of a real-valued process** (value-space Doob
separability; HDP p. 227 footnote, van Handel APM §5.3): some countable
`T₀ ⊆ T` a.s. captures every value `X t ω`, `t ∈ T`, in the closure of the
`T₀`-values.

This is the version-selection hypothesis that uncountable-`sup` chaining
statements mathematically REQUIRE: modifying each `X t` on a `t`-dependent
null set preserves `SubGaussianIncrements` while destroying this property
(and inflating the supremum arbitrarily). Edge behavior: `T = ∅` is
separable with witness `∅`; for `T ≠ ∅` every witness `T₀` is automatically
nonempty since `closure ∅ = ∅`. -/

`ℝ≥0∞` is a complete lattice, and the `C = ∅` corner forces `T = ∅`
