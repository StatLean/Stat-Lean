# Bounded random variables are sub-Gaussian (Hoeffding's lemma)

If a random variable $X$ is bounded, $a \le X \le b$ almost surely, then $X$ is
sub-Gaussian with variance proxy $\sigma^2 = (b - a)^2 / 4$. Equivalently, the
centered moment generating function satisfies
$$\mathbb{E}\!\left[e^{\lambda (X - \mathbb{E} X)}\right] \le
  \exp\!\left(\frac{\lambda^2 (b - a)^2}{8}\right), \qquad \lambda \in \mathbb{R}.$$

(ISBN 978-3-032-03160-0), Chapter 4 (Concentration Inequalities), §4.2,
Theorem 4.6 (Bounded Random Variables); the variance proxy $(b-a)^2/4$ is the
standard statement of Hoeffding's lemma underlying that result.

**Proof formalization notes.** The book's proxy $(b - a)^2 / 4$ is exactly
Mathlib's `(‖b − a‖₊ / 2) ^ 2` (since `‖b − a‖₊ = |b − a|` and
`|b − a|² = (b − a)²`). The result is a direct consequence of Mathlib's Hoeffding
lemma `ProbabilityTheory.hasSubgaussianMGF_of_mem_Icc`, which already centers by
the mean — matching our `IsSubGaussian` (a centered `HasSubgaussianMGF`). The
only added hypothesis relative to the book is the a.e.-measurability of `X`,
which the book leaves implicit as a regularity condition.

**Bibliographic comments.** Hoeffding, W. (1963), "Probability inequalities for
sums of bounded random variables", *Journal of the American Statistical
Association* **58**(301), 13–30. The moment-generating-function bound for a
bounded centered random variable (Hoeffding's lemma) is the key step in the proof
of Theorem 2 of that paper (the Hoeffding inequality for sums of bounded
variables); it is now standard textbook material and is what the variance-proxy
statement formalized here records.
