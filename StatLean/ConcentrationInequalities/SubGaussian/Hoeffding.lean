# Hoeffding's inequality for sums of independent sub-Gaussian variables

Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be independent random variables, each sub-Gaussian with
variance proxy $\sigma^2$. Then for every threshold $t > 0$, the centered
sample mean obeys the one-sided tail bound
$$
  \mathbb{P}\!\left( \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\bigl(X_i - \mathbb{E}X_i\bigr) > t \right)
  \;\le\; \exp\!\left( -\frac{n\,t^2}{2\sigma^2} \right).
$$
Equivalently, the centered sum $\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \mathbb{E}X_i)$ exceeds
$nt$ with the same bound; this is the form we state and prove directly, since
it matches Mathlib's sum-tail lemma applied at threshold $\varepsilon := nt$ to
the centered variables $X_i - \mathbb{E}X_i$. Sub-Gaussianity here is the
`IsSubGaussian` predicate of `…/SubGaussian/Defs.lean`, whose engine is exactly
the centered sub-Gaussian moment-generating-function bound that Mathlib's lemma
consumes.

**Deviation from the book statement.** We state the tail with the
non-strict inequality $nt \le \sum_i (X_i - \mathbb{E}X_i)$ rather than the
book's strict $>$; the strict event is contained in the non-strict one, so the
non-strict bound is at least as strong. We also require $n \ge 1$ explicitly
(the book's "$X_1, \dots, X_n$" presupposes at least one variable) and use a
per-index sub-Gaussian hypothesis $X_i$ for $i < n$. The Lean statement
additionally carries measurability of each $X_i$, a purely technical
requirement of Mathlib's independence-transfer machinery and not a
mathematical assumption of the book.

We additionally record the **scalar-multiple** closure rule used downstream in
OLS / Lasso noise bounds: if $X$ is sub-Gaussian with variance proxy
$\sigma^2$, then $c\,X$ is sub-Gaussian with proxy $c^2\sigma^2$.

**Reference.** Junwei Lu, *Big Data Analysis* (course text), Chapter 4
(Concentration Inequalities), §4.2 (Sub-Gaussian Random Variables),
Theorem 4.7 ("Hoeffding Inequality", `thm:hoefdding`). The scalar-multiple rule
is the elementary closure property of sub-Gaussian variables recorded in the
same section.

**Proof formalization notes.** The centered-sum form is obtained directly from
Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.HasSubgaussianMGF.measure_sum_range_ge_le_of_iIndepFun`
applied at the threshold `ε := n t` to the centered variables `X i − E[X i]` —
precisely the engine wrapped by `IsSubGaussian`. Independence of the original
family is lifted to the centered family via `iIndepFun.comp`; each centered
variable carries the sub-Gaussian MGF bound. The remaining step identifies
Mathlib's RHS `exp(−(nt)² / (2 n σ²))` with the book's `exp(−n t² / (2 σ²))`:
these agree as reals for `n ≥ 1`, including the degenerate corner `σ² = 0`
where both collapse to `exp 0 = 1` via the `x / 0 = 0` convention. The
scalar-multiple rule is delegated to `ProbabilityTheory.HasSubgaussianMGF.const_mul`,
with centering passing through the scalar via `MeasureTheory.integral_const_mul`;
the proxy `c² σ²` is encoded as the `ℝ≥0` element `⟨c², sq_nonneg c⟩ * σ²`,
matching Mathlib's encoding of `const_mul`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The seminal source is W. Hoeffding, "Probability
inequalities for sums of bounded random variables", *Journal of the American
Statistical Association* **58**(301), 1963, pp. 13–30, whose Theorem 2 gives the
exponential tail bound for sums of bounded independent variables. The
sub-Gaussian reformulation stated here replaces the boundedness hypothesis with
a sub-Gaussian variance proxy and follows from the Chernoff bound together with
the moment-generating-function (Hoeffding's lemma) control of each summand; in
this generality it is textbook synthesis / folklore rather than a single
seminal theorem, and is presented as such in modern references (e.g. Boucheron,
Lugosi, Massart, *Concentration Inequalities*, 2013; Vershynin,
*High-Dimensional Probability*, 2018; Wainwright, *High-Dimensional Statistics*,
2019).

If `X` is sub-Gaussian with variance proxy `σ²`, then `c · X` (as
`fun ω => c * X ω`) is sub-Gaussian with proxy `c² σ²`. Centering passes
through the scalar via `MeasureTheory.integral_const_mul`, so this is a
direct corollary of Mathlib's
`ProbabilityTheory.HasSubgaussianMGF.const_mul`. The proxy `c² σ²` is the
`ℝ≥0` element `⟨c², sq_nonneg c⟩ * σ²`, matching Mathlib's encoding of
`const_mul`. Used downstream by OLS / Lasso to scale per-coordinate noise
bounds. -/

/-- **Hoeffding's inequality (centered-sum form), Lu-BDA §4.2 `thm:hoefdding`.**
If `X 0, …, X (n−1)` are jointly independent and each is sub-Gaussian with
variance proxy `σ²` under the probability measure `μ`, then for every `t > 0`,

  `P( ∑_{i<n} (X i − E[X i])  ≥  n t )  ≤  exp(− n t² / (2 σ²))`.

Equivalently, dividing the threshold and the bound by `n` (for `n ≥ 1`):

  `P( (1/n) ∑_{i<n} (X i − E[X i]) ≥ t ) ≤ exp(− n t² / (2 σ²))`,

which is the sample-mean form stated by Lu (the strict inequality `>` is
implied since `{ω | t < S ω} ⊆ {ω | t ≤ S ω}`). Proved by feeding the
centered variables `X i − E[X i]` — the engine of `IsSubGaussian` — into
Mathlib's sum-tail bound
