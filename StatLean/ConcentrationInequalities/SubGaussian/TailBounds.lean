# Two-Sided Tail Probability for Sub-Gaussian Random Variables

Let $X$ be a sub-Gaussian random variable with variance proxy $\sigma^2$ under a
measure $\mu$, and write $\mathbb{E}X = \int X \, d\mu$ for its mean. Then for
every $t \ge 0$:

* **One-sided (Chernoff) tail.** The right deviation satisfies
  $$\mu\bigl(\{t < X - \mathbb{E}X\}\bigr) \le \exp\!\Bigl(-\frac{t^2}{2\sigma^2}\Bigr).$$
  This is the right-tail step used inside the book's proof of the two-sided form.
* **Two-sided tail.** The absolute deviation satisfies
  $$\mu\bigl(\{t < |X - \mathbb{E}X|\}\bigr) \le 2\exp\!\Bigl(-\frac{t^2}{2\sigma^2}\Bigr).$$

The first statement is formalized as `IsSubGaussian.measure_sub_integral_lt_le`
and the second (the headline theorem) as
`IsSubGaussian.measure_abs_sub_integral_lt_le`.

**Added/changed hypotheses.** The book states both bounds for $t > 0$; we use the
weaker hypothesis $t \ge 0$, which yields a (formally) stronger statement (the
$t = 0$ case is trivially true). The strict inequality $t < \cdot$ on the event is
faithful to the book.

**Proof formalization notes.**
Both theorems consume `IsSubGaussian X σ² μ` from
`StatLean/ConcentrationInequalities/SubGaussian/Defs.lean` and reduce to
Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.HasSubgaussianMGF.measure_ge_le` applied to the
centered variable `X − ∫ X dμ`, and (for the left tail) to its negation via
`ProbabilityTheory.HasSubgaussianMGF.neg`. The two-sided form decomposes the
event `t < |X − ∫ X dμ|` as `t < (X − ∫ X dμ) ∨ t < −(X − ∫ X dμ)` (via
`lt_abs`) and combines the right- and left-tail bounds with `measure_union_le`.
The book uses strict `>`; we mirror that with `μ {ω | t < ·}`, packaging the
right-hand side as `ENNReal.ofReal` to bridge from Mathlib's `μ.real`-form bound
to the ENNReal-valued measure; the slack between the strict event `{t < y}` and
the closed event `{t ≤ y}` supplied by the brick is absorbed via the inclusion
`{t < y} ⊆ {t ≤ y}`.

No `IsFiniteMeasure μ` typeclass is assumed at the user surface: the
`HasSubgaussianMGF` predicate embedded in `IsSubGaussian` already forces it,
since integrability of `exp(0 · (X − ∫ X dμ)) = 1` is equivalent to
`IsFiniteMeasure μ`. We derive it as a private lemma and use it internally to
obtain `μ S ≠ ∞` for the `μ.real → μ` conversion.

**Bibliographic comments.**
The two-sided sub-Gaussian tail bound is folklore: it follows immediately from
the defining moment-generating-function bound by an optimized Chernoff argument
and a union bound over the two tails, and has no single seminal origin. The
modern axiomatic theory of sub-Gaussian random variables — the equivalence of
the MGF bound, the tail bound, and the Orlicz-norm characterization — was
systematized by V. V. Buldygin and Yu. V. Kozachenko, "Sub-Gaussian random
variables," *Ukrainian Mathematical Journal* **32** (1980), 483–489. The
underlying technique traces to J.-P. Kahane's study of sub-Gaussian series and
ultimately to the Chernoff/Cramér large-deviation bound. Standard textbook
treatments include M. J. Wainwright, *High-Dimensional Statistics: A
Non-Asymptotic Viewpoint* (Cambridge University Press, 2019), §2.1, and
R. Vershynin, *High-Dimensional Probability* (Cambridge University Press, 2018),
§2.5.

Deviation from the book: Lu states the bound for `t > 0`; we use the weaker

/-- **Two-Sided Tail Probability** for sub-Gaussian variables
(Lu-BDA §4.2, Theorem 4.5 (Two-Sided Tail Probability)).

If `X` is sub-Gaussian with variance proxy `σ²` under `μ`, then for `0 ≤ t`,
`μ {ω | t < |X ω − ∫ X dμ|} ≤ 2 · exp(−t² / (2σ²))`.

Proof (book): `t < |Y|` decomposes as `t < Y ∨ t < −Y` (`lt_abs`); apply the
one-sided Chernoff bound `HasSubgaussianMGF.measure_ge_le` to `Y := X − ∫ X dμ`
for the right tail and to `-Y` (via `HasSubgaussianMGF.neg`) for the left
tail; combine with `measure_union_le`.

Deviation from the book: Lu states the bound for `t > 0`; we use the weaker
`0 ≤ t` to match Mathlib's brick. -/
