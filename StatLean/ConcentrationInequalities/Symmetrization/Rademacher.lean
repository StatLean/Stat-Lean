# The Rademacher law and the canonical sign vector

A *Rademacher (symmetric Bernoulli) random variable* $\varepsilon$ takes the
values $\pm 1$ with probability $\tfrac12$ each:
$$ \mathbb{P}(\varepsilon = 1) = \mathbb{P}(\varepsilon = -1) = \tfrac12. $$
This file defines its law `radLaw` $= \tfrac12\delta_{1} + \tfrac12\delta_{-1}$
on $\mathbb{R}$ and the canonical vector of $N$ independent Rademacher signs
`signVec N` $= \mathrm{radLaw}^{\otimes N}$ on $\mathrm{Fin}\,N \to \mathbb{R}$,
together with their integral / a.e. / pushforward API. Throughout the
symmetrization chapter, auxiliary sign randomness lives on this explicit
product space (as the second coordinate of `μ.prod (signVec N)`), never on the
abstract sample space.

**Reference.** Roman Vershynin, *High-Dimensional Probability*, 2nd ed.,
Cambridge University Press, §6.3 (symmetric Bernoulli signs
$\varepsilon_1,\dots,\varepsilon_N$, p. 179); the symmetric Bernoulli
distribution itself is §2.2.

**Proof formalization notes.** `radLaw` is a weighted sum of two Dirac
measures on `ℝ` (not `PMF.bernoulli` on `Bool`): integrals against it compute
*unconditionally* for every `f : ℝ → ℝ` (every `f` is a.e. equal to a two-value
simple function, hence integrable), via `integral_dirac` +
`integral_add_measure`. The property "takes values ±1" is the a.e. statement
`radLaw_ae_pm` / `signVec_ae_pm`. The `2^N` finite-average representation of
`signVec` is deliberately not provided: contraction uses coordinate-convexity
induction and the symmetrization flip uses measure-preserving maps, so only
the pushforward API below is ever consumed. Named-sorry fallback of this work
item: `signVec_map_mul_pm` (the vertex change of variables of Theorem 6.6.1),
via `Measure.pi_map_pi` + `radLaw_map_mul_pm`; all scalar `radLaw` lemmas are
provable directly from `integral_dirac` / `Measure.map_dirac`.

**Bibliographic comments.** Rademacher functions originate with H. Rademacher,
"Einige Sätze über Reihen von allgemeinen Orthogonalfunktionen," *Math. Ann.*
87 (1922), 112–138; their systematic use as random signs in Banach-space
probability is classical (Kahane, *Some Random Series of Functions*, 1968).
The present role as the carrier of symmetrization follows HDP §6.3 and its
end-of-chapter Notes.
