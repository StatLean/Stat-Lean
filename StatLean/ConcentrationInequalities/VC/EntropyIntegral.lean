# The Dudley entropy integral for VC classes

The entropy-integral evaluation used in Theorem 8.3.15's proof: with the
sample-independent covering bound
$N(T', \varepsilon) \le (4/\varepsilon)^{22 d}$ on $(0, 2)$,
$$ \int_0^2 \sqrt{22\, d \, \log\bigl(4/\varepsilon\bigr)}\;d\varepsilon
   \;\le\; 27 \sqrt{d}. $$

**Reference.** Roman Vershynin, *High-Dimensional Probability*, 2nd ed.,
Cambridge University Press, §8.3.6 — the "bounded entropy integral" step in
the proof of Theorem 8.3.15 (the book leaves the integral as an unnamed
absolute constant).

**Proof formalization notes.** VC owns its own entropy integral (batch
decision R7): this file is self-contained interval-integral analysis with no
stub dependencies, and `VC/LawOfLargeNumbers.lean` plugs it into the
chaining cluster's `dudley_inequality_abs` directly. The `22` (not the
covering theorem's `21`) absorbs the factor-2 covering loss from the
symmetrized index set `T' = empProj '' F ∪ (−(empProj '' F))`, and the
`4/ε` (not `2/ε`) extends the bound to the full diameter range
`ε ∈ (0, 2)`. Evaluation is by the crude comparison `log y ≤ y − 1 ≤ y`
(`Real.log_le_sub_one_of_pos`), giving
`√(log(4/ε)) ≤ 2/√ε`, and `∫₀² ε^{−1/2} dε = 2√2`; the frozen numeral is
`27` from `√22 · 2 · 2√2 = 8√44 ≈ 26.53 ≤ 27`. Integrability of the
integrand near `0` is by domination by `ε^{−1/2}` (integrable rpow,
exponent `> −1`). Edge behavior: the integrand is junk (`log` of a
nonpositive argument) outside `(0, 4)`, but the interval of integration is
`(0, 2)`. Named-sorry fallback of this work item: `entropyIntegral_le`
(keep the two helper lemmas real; sorry only the final interval-integral
assembly).

**Bibliographic comments.** The entropy integral is R. M. Dudley's ("The
sizes of compact subsets of Hilbert space and continuity of Gaussian
processes," *J. Funct. Anal.* 1 (1967), 290–330); its finiteness for VC
classes — the fact that `∫₀² √(d·log(4/ε)) dε ≍ √d` — is the engine of the
uniform CLT/LLN for VC classes, HDP §8.3 Notes.
