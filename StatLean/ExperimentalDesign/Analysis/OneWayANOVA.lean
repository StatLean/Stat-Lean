# The one-way analysis-of-variance identity

For observed data `y : U → ℝ` on the units of a completed one-way (completely
randomised) experiment with treatment assignment `g : U → T`, the **analysis of
variance identity** splits the total variation around the grand mean into
between-treatment and within-treatment (residual) parts:
$$\underbrace{\sum_i (y_i - \bar y)^2}_{SS_{\rm Total}}
  = \underbrace{\sum_i (\bar y_{g(i)} - \bar y)^2}_{SS_{\rm Treatment}}
  + \underbrace{\sum_i (y_i - \bar y_{g(i)})^2}_{SS_{\rm Residual}},$$
where `ȳ_t` is the mean of the arm of `t` and `ȳ` the grand mean.  The between part
also takes the familiar grouped form `∑_t n_t (ȳ_t − ȳ)²`.  This is the purely
algebraic content of the ANOVA table; distributional facts (χ², F) belong to
`HypothesisTesting` adapters, not here.

The assignment enters only as a fixed function `g` — the identity holds for every
allocation, which is exactly why it can be combined with randomisation moments
downstream (`Mead §9.4` takes expectations of these same sums of squares).

## Main results

* `totalSS`, `treatmentSS`, `residualSS` — the three sums of squares (all as sums
  over units, avoiding empty-group conventions).
* `sum_sub_armMean_eq_zero` — within-arm residuals sum to zero.
* `anova_decomposition` — `SS_Total = SS_Treatment + SS_Residual`.
* `treatmentSS_eq_sum_card` — the grouped form `∑_t n_t (ȳ_t − ȳ)²`.
* `totalSS_nonneg`, `treatmentSS_nonneg`, `residualSS_nonneg`,
  `residualSS_le_totalSS` — positivity and the trivial bound.

**Reference.** R. Mead, *The Design of Experiments*, CUP, 1988: the analysis of
variance identity, §2.2 (randomised blocks; the same partition argument) and the
completely randomised design's treatment/residual table, §6.2 (Table 6.1, between-
and within-treatment SS); the treatment-structure identity, §3.4.  (`Mead §2.2`,
`Mead §6.2`, `Mead §3.4`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* `treatmentSS` and `residualSS` are sums over *units* of quantities built from
  `armMean y (g i) g`; since the arm of `g i` always contains `i`, no empty-arm
  division convention is ever exercised, and the identity holds without any
  nonemptiness hypotheses.
* The decomposition is the cross-term computation: split
  `(y_i − ȳ) = (y_i − ȳ_{g(i)}) + (ȳ_{g(i)} − ȳ)`, expand, and kill the cross term
  by fibering the sum over arms (`Finset.sum_fiberwise`-style) and applying
  `sum_sub_armMean_eq_zero` arm by arm.
* `treatmentSS_eq_sum_card` is the same fibering applied to the constant-on-arms
  summand.
