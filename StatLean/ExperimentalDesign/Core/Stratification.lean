# Stratification of a finite population

A **stratification** (block structure) of the population `U` is a labelling
`st : U → B` into finitely many strata (blocks); the stratum of label `b` is the
subtype `{i // st i = b}`.  This file provides the deterministic decomposition
algebra shared by *blocked experiments* and *stratified sampling*:
$$N = \sum_b N_b, \qquad Y = \sum_b Y_b, \qquad
  \bar y = \sum_b \frac{N_b}{N}\, \bar y_b,$$
where `N_b`, `Y_b`, `ȳ_b` are the stratum size, total and mean.

Blocked randomization (`Randomization/Blocked`) and stratified sampling
(`Stratified/`) both instantiate one generic product-design construction over these
strata; the identities here are the deterministic half of every blockwise
unbiasedness statement.

## Main results

* `Stratum` — the stratum subtype.
* `sum_card_stratum` — stratum sizes partition the population size.
* `populationTotal_stratified` — the total decomposes over strata.
* `populationMean_stratified` — the mean is the size-weighted average of stratum
  means.

**Reference.** R. Mead, *The Design of Experiments*, Cambridge University Press,
1988, §7.1–§7.2 (design principles in blocked experiments: units grouped into blocks,
comparisons arranged within blocks) and §2.2 (block totals and means in the analysis
of variance identity).  (`Mead §7.2`, `Mead §2.2`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* Strata are subtypes, so stratum summaries are the `FinitePopulation` summaries of
  the restricted quantity `fun i : Stratum st b => y i` — no new definitions needed.
* Empty strata are allowed: their size weight is `0` and their (convention-valued)
  mean is multiplied by `0`, so the decompositions hold without nonemptiness
  hypotheses on individual strata.
* `populationMean_stratified` needs `Nonempty U` (for `N ≠ 0`); the empty-population
  version would read `0 = 0` but the proof divides by `N`.
