# Expectation, variance and covariance of a real statistic under a finite PMF

Design-based inference (randomization theory of experiments, design-based survey
sampling) computes moments of real statistics under a *finite* randomization
distribution: a `PMF Ω` with `Ω` a `Fintype`.  This file provides the elementary
sum-based moment calculus for that setting:
$$\mathbb E_D[f] = \sum_{\omega} D(\omega)\, f(\omega), \qquad
  \operatorname{Var}_D(f) = \mathbb E_D[(f - \mathbb E_D f)^2], \qquad
  \operatorname{Cov}_D(f,g) = \mathbb E_D[(f - \mathbb E_D f)(g - \mathbb E_D g)],$$
together with linearity, monotonicity, the pushforward identity
$\mathbb E_{g_* D}[f] = \mathbb E_D[f \circ g]$, the uniform-law counting formulas, and
the bilinear expansion $\operatorname{Var}(\sum_i f_i) = \sum_{i,j}\operatorname{Cov}(f_i,f_j)$.

Everything is a finite sum in `ℝ`; no integration theory enters.  This keeps every
downstream design computation (assignment probabilities, Horvitz–Thompson moments,
ANOVA expectations) inside elementary algebra, mirroring the treatment of
randomization moments in `StatLean.HypothesisTesting.ForMathlib.HypergeometricMoments`
(which works with a bespoke uniform average; the present file is the general-`PMF`
version needed once non-uniform designs appear).

## Main results

* `pmfExpect`, `pmfVar`, `pmfCov` — the finite moment functionals.
* `sum_pmf_toReal`, `pmfExpect_const`, `pmfExpect_add`, `pmfExpect_smul`,
  `pmfExpect_sum`, `pmfExpect_nonneg`, `pmfExpect_mono` — expectation calculus.
* `pmfExpect_map` — expectation under a pushforward design.
* `pmfExpect_uniformOfFinset`, `pmfExpect_uniformOfFintype` — counting formulas.
* `pmfVar_eq_expect_sq_sub_sq`, `pmfCov_eq_expect_mul_sub_mul` — computational forms.
* `pmfVar_sum` — variance of a sum as a double sum of covariances.
* `pmfVar_smul`, `pmfVar_add_const`, `pmfCov_smul_smul` — scaling rules.

**Reference.** These are the standard first- and second-moment manipulations of the
finite randomization model; see R. Mead, *The Design of Experiments: Statistical
Principles for Practical Applications*, Cambridge University Press, 1988
(ISBN 0-521-24512-5), §9.4 (randomisation theory of the analysis of experimental
data), where they are used throughout.  (`Mead §9.4`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* `pmfExpect` is a plain `Finset.univ` sum with weights `(D ω).toReal`; the weights sum
  to `1` (`sum_pmf_toReal`) because a `PMF` has total mass one and every value is
  finite (`PMF.apply_ne_top`), so `ENNReal.toReal` is additive on it.
* No `Nonempty Ω` assumptions appear: `PMF Ω` itself forces `Ω` nonempty when needed,
  and statements are phrased to be true degenerately otherwise.
* `pmfVar`/`pmfCov` are defined in centered form; the computational
  (`E[f²] − (E f)²`) forms are derived, not taken as definitions, so that
  nonnegativity of the variance is immediate from `pmfExpect_nonneg`.
