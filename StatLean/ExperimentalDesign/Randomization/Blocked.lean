# Blocked (randomised block) randomization

A **blocked randomization** runs an independent completely randomised design inside
each block of a stratification `bl : U → B`, with per-block replications
`r b : T → ℕ`.  The randomised complete block design of the textbooks is the special
case `r b t = 1` (each treatment once per block).  This file constructs the design as
a product design over the blocks, glues the per-block allocations into a single
allocation of the whole population, and proves:

* the **marginal assignment probability** of a unit is its within-block allocation
  frequency `r_{b(i)}(t) / N_{b(i)}`;
* assignments in **different blocks are uncorrelated** — the independence that kills
  all cross-block terms in randomisation-theory variance computations.

Deeper blocked moments (within-block pair probabilities, blocked arm means) are
inherited from `CompleteRandomization` through the product-design marginal lemmas
and are deferred to a later round.

## Main results

* `blockedRandomization` — the design.
* `glueAllocation` — the combined allocation of the whole population.
* `blocked_expect_armIndicator` — the marginal assignment probability.
* `blocked_cov_armIndicator_of_ne_block` — independence across blocks.

**Reference.** R. Mead, *The Design of Experiments*, CUP, 1988: the randomised block
design and its restricted randomisation — each treatment allocated within each block,
independently across blocks — §2.5, §9.2 (design (ii)) and §9.4 (where
`δᵏᵢⱼ δᵏ'ᵢ'ⱼ'` are independent for different blocks `i ≠ i'`).  (`Mead §2.5`,
`Mead §9.2`, `Mead §9.4`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The sample space is the dependent product `∀ b, Allocation (Stratum bl b) T`; the
  glued allocation evaluates the block component of `bl i` at `⟨i, rfl⟩`.
* Both theorems are compositions: rewrite the glued indicator as a statistic of the
  single component `ω (bl i)`, then apply `pmfExpect_productDesign_comp` /
  `pmfCov_productDesign_of_ne` and (for the marginal) `expect_armIndicator` for the
  within-block completely randomised design.
