# Basis pursuit — cone membership and uniqueness from a trivial cone–null intersection

Let $X$ be an $n \times d$ design matrix and let $\beta^\star$ be a vector supported on
an index set $S \subseteq \{1, \dots, d\}$ (so $\beta^\star_j = 0$ for $j \notin S$).
Basis pursuit recovers $\beta^\star$ from $Y = X\beta^\star$ by solving the $\ell^1$
minimization problem $\min_{\beta} \lVert \beta \rVert_1$ subject to $X\beta = Y$. Write
$C(S)$ for the cone of vectors $\Delta$ whose off-support mass is dominated by their
on-support mass, $\lVert \Delta_{S^c} \rVert_1 \le \lVert \Delta_S \rVert_1$, and write
$\mathrm{Null}(X) = \ker X$ for the null space. This file proves the two shared
structural facts:

* **Cone membership.** If $\hat\beta$ is any basis-pursuit solution for $Y = X\beta^\star$,
  then the error $\Delta = \hat\beta - \beta^\star$ lies in the cone $C(S)$, i.e.
  $\lVert (\hat\beta - \beta^\star)_{S^c} \rVert_1 \le \lVert (\hat\beta - \beta^\star)_S \rVert_1$.
* **Uniqueness.** If the cone meets the null space only at the origin,
  $C(S) \cap \mathrm{Null}(X) = \{0\}$, then for every $\beta^\star$ supported on $S$ the
  basis-pursuit problem for $Y = X\beta^\star$ has $\beta^\star$ as its *unique* minimizer.

These are the two lemmas that the cone theorem (`ConeTheorem.lean`, Lu-BDA §8.2
`thm:cone`, Theorem 8.1) and the RIP recovery theorem (`RIPRecovery.lean`, Lu-BDA §9.1
`thm:rip`, Theorem 9.1) both rely on:

* `deviation_mem_cone_of_basisPursuit` — optimality of basis pursuit forces the error
  `Δ = β̂ − β*` into the cone `C(S) = reCone S 1` (book eq:cone-ineq).
* `unique_basisPursuit_of_cone_trivial` — if `C(S) ∩ Null(X) = {0}` then `β*` is the
  unique basis-pursuit solution (the sufficiency core, shared by both theorems).

Concept-layer (theorem-agnostic); the cone `C(S)` is `reCone S 1` from `Lasso/Defs.lean`.
The condition $C(S) \cap \mathrm{Null}(X) = \{0\}$ is the support-restricted form of the
null-space property of compressed sensing.

**Reference.** Junwei Lu, *Big Data Analysis*, Chapter 8 (Compressive Sensing), §8.2
(Compressive Sensing), Theorem 8.1 (`thm:cone`) and Eq (8.3) (`eq:cone-ineq`); the
uniqueness clause is the sufficiency direction of the same theorem, and the recovery half
is reused in Chapter 9 (Restricted Isometry Property), §9.1, Theorem 9.1 (`thm:rip`).

**Proof formalization notes.**

* *Cone membership* (`deviation_mem_cone_of_basisPursuit`, via the shared engine
  `mem_cone_of_feasible_of_le`). From basis-pursuit feasibility $\lVert\hat\beta\rVert_1
  \le \lVert\beta^\star\rVert_1$, split the $\ell^1$ norm over $S$ and $S^c$
  (`l1Norm_split`). Since $\beta^\star$ is supported on $S$, its $S^c$-restriction
  vanishes, so $\lVert\beta^\star\rVert_1 = \lVert\beta^\star_S\rVert_1$. Writing
  $\hat\beta = \beta^\star + \Delta$ and applying the reverse triangle inequality on the
  $S$-block (`l1Norm_sub_le`) yields
  $\lVert\Delta_{S^c}\rVert_1 \le \lVert\Delta_S\rVert_1$, i.e. $\Delta \in C(S)$.
* *Uniqueness* (`unique_basisPursuit_of_cone_trivial`). Any feasible competitor $\beta$
  with $\lVert\beta\rVert_1 \le \lVert\beta^\star\rVert_1$ has deviation $\Delta =
  \beta - \beta^\star$ both in $\mathrm{Null}(X)$ (same image, $X\beta = X\beta^\star$)
  and in $C(S)$ (cone membership above), hence $\Delta \in C(S) \cap \mathrm{Null}(X) =
  \{0\}$, so $\beta = \beta^\star$. The optimality clause of `IsUniqueBasisPursuit` is
  then immediate (uniqueness collapses the only smaller-or-equal-norm competitor onto
  $\beta^\star$).

**Bibliographic comments.** The characterization that $\ell^1$ minimization recovers
every $k$-sparse vector exactly iff a cone/null-space transversality condition holds is
the *null-space property* (NSP) of compressed sensing. The clean range-vs-null-space
formulation used here originates with A. Cohen, W. Dahmen and R. DeVore, "Compressed
sensing and best $k$-term approximation", *Journal of the American Mathematical Society*
22 (2009), no. 1, 211–231, which proves that the null-space property is equivalent to
instance-optimal recovery; earlier exact-recovery/uniqueness conditions of this flavor
appear in D. L. Donoho and X. Huo, "Uncertainty principles and ideal atomic
decomposition", *IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory* 47 (2001), no. 7, 2845–2862, and in
R. Gribonval and M. Nielsen, "Sparse representations in unions of bases", *IEEE Trans.
Inform. Theory* 49 (2003), no. 12, 3320–3325. The support-restricted version proven
here ($C(S) \cap \mathrm{Null}(X) = \{0\}$ for a fixed $S$) is the textbook (Lu-BDA §8.2)
packaging of that property and is standard; it is the deterministic core later combined
with the restricted-isometry property to give probabilistic recovery guarantees
(E. J. Candès and T. Tao, "Decoding by linear programming", *IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory*
51 (2005), no. 12, 4203–4215).

/-- **Optimality ⟹ cone membership** (Lu §8.2, Eq (8.3)). If `β*` is supported on
`S` and `β̂` is a basis-pursuit solution for `Y = X β*`, then the error `β̂ − β*`
lies in the cone `C(S) = reCone S 1`, i.e. `‖(β̂−β*)_{Sᶜ}‖₁ ≤ ‖(β̂−β*)_S‖₁`.

Proof (book): from feasibility `‖β̂‖₁ ≤ ‖β*‖₁`, split `‖·‖₁` over `S`/`Sᶜ`
(`l1Norm_split`), use `β*` supported on `S` and the reverse triangle inequality on the
`S`-block. -/

/-- **Cone-condition ⟹ unique recovery** (Lu §8.2, sufficiency of `thm:cone`, Theorem 8.1). If the
cone `C(S) = reCone S 1` meets the null space `Null(X) = ker (designMap X)` only at
`0`, then for any `β*` supported on `S` the basis-pursuit problem for `Y = X β*` has
`β*` as its unique solution.

Proof (book): any feasible competitor `β` with `‖β‖₁ ≤ ‖β*‖₁` has `Δ = β − β* ∈
Null(X)` (same image) and `Δ ∈ C(S)` (by `deviation_mem_cone_of_basisPursuit`), hence
`Δ ∈ C(S) ∩ Null(X) = {0}`, so `β = β*`. -/
