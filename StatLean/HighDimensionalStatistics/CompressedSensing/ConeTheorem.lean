# The cone theorem (exact basis-pursuit recovery iff trivial cone–nullspace intersection)

Let $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ be a design matrix and $S \subseteq \{1,\dots,d\}$
a support set. *Basis pursuit* recovers a target $\beta^\star$ as the $\ell_1$-minimizer
among all coefficients consistent with the observations $X\beta^\star$. The theorem
characterizes exactly when basis pursuit recovers every $S$-supported target uniquely:

> Basis pursuit has $\beta^\star$ as its **unique** solution for every $\beta^\star$
> supported on $S$ **if and only if** the cone meets the null space only at the origin,
> $$ \mathcal{C}(S) \cap \mathrm{Null}(X) = \{0\}, $$
> where $\mathcal{C}(S) = \{\Delta : \lVert \Delta_{S^c} \rVert_1 \le \lVert \Delta_S \rVert_1\}$
> is the descent cone and $\mathrm{Null}(X)$ is the null space (kernel) of $X$.

In the formalization $\mathcal{C}(S)$ is `reCone S 1` and $\mathrm{Null}(X)$ is
`LinearMap.ker (designMap X)`. The bound $\lVert \Delta_{S^c} \rVert_1 \le \lVert \Delta_S \rVert_1$
appears as the factor-`1` form $\lVert \Delta_{S^c} \rVert_1 \le 1 \cdot \lVert \Delta_S \rVert_1$
of the general cone; no constants are changed relative to the book.

(ISBN 978-3-032-03160-0). Chapter 8 (Compressive Sensing), §8.2, Theorem 8.1. The
descent cone $\mathcal{C}(S)$ is Definition 8.3 (Cone Condition).

**Proof formalization notes.**
The sufficiency (`⟸`) is `unique_basisPursuit_of_cone_trivial` (`BasisPursuit.lean`).
The necessity (`⟹`) is `cone_trivial_of_unique_basisPursuit` below (book contrapositive:
a nonzero `v ∈ C(S) ∩ Null(X)` yields a feasible competitor to `restrict S v`). The
biconditional `basisPursuit_unique_iff_cone_inter_ker` assembles the two directions.

**Bibliographic comments.**
The condition $\mathcal{C}(S) \cap \mathrm{Null}(X) = \{0\}$ is the support-restricted
form of the **null space property** (NSP) for $\ell_1$ recovery. Its equivalence with exact
$\ell_1$ recovery of all $S$-supported (more generally, $k$-sparse) vectors was established by
A. Cohen, W. Dahmen, and R. DeVore, "Compressed sensing and best $k$-term approximation,"
*Journal of the American Mathematical Society*, vol. 22, no. 1, pp. 211–231, 2009 (see their
null-space characterization of instance-optimal decoders). An earlier exact-recovery
criterion via an uncertainty principle for ideal atomic decomposition appears in
D. L. Donoho and X. Huo, "Uncertainty principles and ideal atomic decomposition,"
*IEEE Transactions on Information Theory*, vol. 47, no. 7, pp. 2845–2862, 2001. The
clean cone-versus-nullspace phrasing used here is standard textbook synthesis of these
sources; the support-restricted statement formalized below is not attributed to a single
seminal theorem.

/-- **Necessity** of the cone condition (Lu-BDA §8.2, Theorem 8.1 ⟹). If basis pursuit
uniquely recovers every `β*` supported on `S`, then `C(S) ∩ Null(X) = {0}`.

Proof (book): suppose `0 ≠ v ∈ Null(X) ∩ C(S)`. Take `β* = restrict S v` (supported on
`S`) and the competitor `β = -restrict Sᶜ v`; then `X β = X β*` (since `X v = 0`) and
`‖β‖₁ = ‖v_{Sᶜ}‖₁ ≤ ‖v_S‖₁ = ‖β*‖₁` by `v ∈ C(S)`. Uniqueness forces `β = β*`,
i.e. `v = 0`, a contradiction. -/
