# Fixed-design linear model — definitions

Consider the fixed-design linear model with design matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$,
unknown coefficient vector $\beta^* \in \mathbb{R}^d$, and response
$Y = X\beta^* + \varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}^n$, where $\varepsilon$ is the noise vector.
The ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimator $\hat\beta^{\mathrm{LS}}$ is defined as a
*minimiser* of the residual sum of squares
$$\hat\beta^{\mathrm{LS}} \in \arg\min_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^d} \; \|Y - X\beta\|^2,$$
and the prediction mean squared error of a fitted coefficient $\hat\beta$ is
$$\mathrm{MSE}(X\hat\beta) = \tfrac{1}{n}\,\|X\hat\beta - X\beta^*\|^2.$$

These definitions formalise the model setup behind the OLS MSE theorem
(Lu-BDA §7.2, Theorem 7.1). Two deliberate choices, aligned with the Lean
statements below:

* The OLS estimator is characterised by the **minimiser (zero-order)
  condition**, not the closed form $(X^\top X)^{-1} X^\top Y$, which need not
  exist when $X$ is rank-deficient — exactly the regime the MSE theorem covers.
* The degenerate case $n = 0$ yields $\mathrm{MSE} = 0$, since the factor
  $1/n$ is taken to be $0$.

Theorem 7.1 (Mean Squared Error of Least Squares) (model
$Y = X\beta^* + \varepsilon$; OLS as RSS minimiser;
$\mathrm{MSE}(X\hat\beta) = \tfrac{1}{n}\|X\hat\beta - X\beta^*\|^2$).

**Proof formalization notes.**
Vectors live in `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin ·)` (the ℓ²/inner-product space used
throughout the library). The design matrix acts as the linear map
`Matrix.toEuclideanLin X : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d) →ₗ[ℝ] EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)`.
These are concept-layer, theorem-agnostic definitions consumed by
`OLS/MSEExpectation.lean` and `OLS/MSEHighProb.lean`. The book's design rank
$r = \mathrm{rank}(X)$ is the dimension of the column space $C(X)$ (the range of
the design map); here `designRank` is taken as `Matrix.rank X`.

**Bibliographic comments.**
The fixed-design linear model and ordinary least squares are classical and
folklore, with no single seminal paper. The method of least squares was
introduced by A. M. Legendre, *Nouvelles méthodes pour la détermination des
orbites des comètes* (Paris, 1805), and given its probabilistic justification by
C. F. Gauss, *Theoria motus corporum coelestium* (1809); the optimality of OLS
among linear unbiased estimators is the Gauss–Markov theorem (Gauss 1821–1823;
A. A. Markov, *Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung*, 1912). The prediction-error
analysis used here (MSE of the fitted projection $X\hat\beta$) is standard
textbook material rather than an original research result.

deliberately *not* a closed form, so it is well-defined for rank-deficient `X`. -/
