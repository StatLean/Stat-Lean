# Subspace Lipschitz (compatibility) constant — defining inequality

For a regularizer (seminorm) $\Phi$ on a finite-dimensional inner-product space and a subspace
$S$, the **subspace Lipschitz constant** (Wainwright's *subspace compatibility constant*) is
$$\Psi(S) \;=\; \sup_{u \in S \setminus \{0\}} \frac{\Phi(u)}{\lVert u\rVert},$$
where $\lVert\cdot\rVert$ is the inner-product (Euclidean) norm. The constant measures how much the
regularizer can stretch a unit vector confined to $S$. Its **defining inequality** is the linear
bound it yields on $S$:
$$\Phi(u) \;\le\; \Psi(S)\,\lVert u\rVert \qquad \text{for all } u \in S.$$
This is exactly the property invoked by the estimation-error results (Theorem 9.19, Corollary 9.20,
Theorem 9.24), where it appears as step (iii) of equation (9.45).

The companion fact $\Psi(S) \ge 0$ is also recorded.

**Reference.** M. J. Wainwright, *High-Dimensional Statistics: A Non-Asymptotic Viewpoint*,
Cambridge University Press, 2019. Chapter 9 (Decomposability and restricted strong convexity),
Definition 9.18 (subspace compatibility constant); the defining inequality is step (iii) of
Eq. (9.45) in the proof of the estimation-error bound.

**Proof formalization notes.** The non-trivial content is that the supremum defining $\Psi(S)$ is
over a set that is **bounded above**, so that `le_csSup` applies and gives the defining inequality.
Boundedness holds because *any* seminorm $\Phi$ on a finite-dimensional inner-product space is
dominated by a multiple of the norm: choosing an orthonormal basis $(b_i)$,
$$\Phi(x) \le \sum_i \lvert\langle b_i, x\rangle\rvert\,\Phi(b_i)
            \le \Big(\textstyle\sum_i \Phi(b_i)\Big)\,\lVert x\rVert$$
by subadditivity, homogeneity, and Cauchy–Schwarz ($\lvert\langle b_i, x\rangle\rvert \le
\lVert b_i\rVert\,\lVert x\rVert = \lVert x\rVert$). This is `seminorm_le_const_mul_norm`, which
supplies the upper bound `C` witnessing that the ratio set is bounded above. In `subspaceLip_le`
the case `u = 0` is handled separately (both sides vanish, `map_zero`); for `u ≠ 0` the ratio
$\Phi(u)/\lVert u\rVert$ is a member of the set whose `sSup` is $\Psi(S)$. In the degenerate case
`S = 0` the ratio set is empty and `sSup ∅ = 0`, consistent with `subspaceLip_nonneg`.

This is a concept-layer helper (theorem-agnostic); consumed by `Bound.lean` and `DualBound.lean`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The subspace compatibility / Lipschitz constant originates with
S. N. Negahban, P. Ravikumar, M. J. Wainwright and B. Yu, "A Unified Framework for
High-Dimensional Analysis of $M$-Estimators with Decomposable Regularizers," *Statistical Science*
27 (4), 538–557, 2012, where it is introduced as the **subspace compatibility constant**
$\Psi(\mathcal{M}) = \sup_{u \in \mathcal{M}\setminus\{0\}} \mathcal{R}(u)/\lVert u\rVert_2$
(their Definition 3) to convert a regularizer bound on the model subspace into an $\ell_2$-norm
bound inside the master oracle inequality (their Theorem 1). Wainwright's 2019 textbook
(Definition 9.18) is the streamlined exposition of that paper; the bound formalized here is the
elementary, regularizer-agnostic lemma underlying both.
