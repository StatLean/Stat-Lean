# The parametric bootstrap: plug-in at an estimated parameter, and local power

In a parametric model indexed by `θ` in a finite-dimensional parameter space, the bootstrap
substitutes an estimator `thHat n` for the unknown `θ` inside the sampling distribution
`Jpar n θ` of a root. Consistency here is a statement **in probability**, not almost surely:
the estimated parameter sequence does not stay inside any fixed local class with probability
one, only along suitably chosen subsequences.

This file contains:

* `tendsto_supCDFDist_parametric_fixed` — uniform convergence of the sampling distribution at
  the true parameter to the limit law;
* `tendstoInMeasure_supCDFDist_parametric_plugIn` — the plug-in display: the sampling
  distribution at the estimated parameter is uniformly close, in probability, to the one at the
  true parameter;
* `tendstoInMeasure_supCDFDist_parametric_bootstrap` — the two displays combined;
* `tendsto_bootstrapTest_local_power` — the limiting power of the bootstrap test against
  contiguous alternatives `θ + n^{-1/2} hdir`.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and J.P. Romano, *Testing Statistical Hypotheses*, 4th ed.,
Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2022 (ISBN 978-3-030-70577-0), Chapter 18 (Bootstrap and
Subsampling Methods), §18.3 (Bootstrap Sampling Distributions), Theorem 18.3.2 (the uniform
consistency form, applied to a plug-in at an estimated parameter) and Corollary 18.3.1
(bootstrap test local power). (`TSH4 §18.3 Thm 18.3.2, Cor 18.3.1`.)

**Designed deviation (subsequence route replaces the almost sure representation).** The
reference argument passes to an almost sure representation: it constructs, on a new probability
space, a copy of the estimator that converges almost surely, concludes the almost sure version
of the display for the copy, and transfers the conclusion back because the two estimators have
the same law. Constructing that representation is a substantial piece of machinery. We instead
take the **local uniformity over compact sets of local parameters** as the explicit hypothesis
(`hlocunif` below: convergence of the sampling distribution is uniform over parameters
`θ + n^{-1/2} t` with `‖t‖ ≤ M`) and drive the conclusion by the subsequence characterisation of
convergence in probability. The two routes prove the same display; the hypothesis we assume is
exactly the local uniformity that the reference derives from its local asymptotic theory.

**Designed deviation (tightness rather than bare consistency).** Mere consistency
`thHat n → θ` in probability does **not** activate a compact-`t` local uniformity hypothesis:
the estimator may leave every `n^{-1/2}`-neighbourhood of `θ`. The reference setup supplies
`n^{1/2}`-consistency through the efficiency of the estimator it uses. We therefore state the
honest input — uniform tightness of `n^{1/2}(thHat n − θ)` — which implies consistency and is
what the argument consumes.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* Convergence in probability of the uniform distance is `TendstoInMeasure` against the constant
  function `0`; the underlying distance on `ℝ` is the usual one.
* The local-uniformity hypothesis is stated in eventually-`∀`-`ε` form rather than as a
  supremum over a compact set, which avoids the junk value of a supremum over an index type
  that is not known to be nonempty.
* In `tendsto_bootstrapTest_local_power` the two hypotheses `hlocalCLT` and `hcritval` are
  **not** free-choice inputs: they are the local limit theory of the estimator under contiguous
  alternatives, and the convergence of the estimated critical value under those alternatives.
  They are recorded here as explicit hypotheses only because the local-asymptotics layer of
  this area is developed in a separate module; when that layer lands they must be discharged
  from it rather than supplied by callers. They are flagged as such on their tags.

/-- **Plug-in display for the parametric bootstrap.**

If the sampling distribution converges to the limit law uniformly over parameters in
`n^{-1/2}`-neighbourhoods of `θ` of bounded rescaled radius, and if `n^{1/2}(thHat n − θ)` is
uniformly tight, then substituting the estimator for the true parameter perturbs the sampling
distribution by a uniformly negligible amount, in probability.

**Signature amendment (the limit law must be a distribution function).** As frozen — with
`hlim_cont` as the only hypothesis on `Jlim θ` — the statement is **false**, and the added
`hlim_cdf : IsCDF (Jlim θ)` is exactly what repairs it. The reason is the junk value of an
unbounded real supremum: `supCDFDist F G = ⨆ t, |F t − G t|` is `0` whenever that family is
unbounded (`Real.iSup_of_not_bddAbove`), so for an unbounded *continuous* `Jlim θ` every
`supCDFDist (·) (Jlim θ)` collapses to `0` and `hlocunif` becomes vacuous while the conclusion
still has content. Concretely, take `k = 1`, `θ = 0`, `Jlim θ = id` (continuous, unbounded),
`Jpar n t x = stdNormalCDF (x − n^{1/2} t)` (a genuine distribution function for every `n, t`)
and the deterministic estimator `thHat n ω = n^{-1/2}`. Then `n^{1/2}(thHat n − θ) ≡ 1` is
tight, `hlocunif` holds vacuously, and yet
`supCDFDist (Jpar n (thHat n ω)) (Jpar n θ)` is the (positive, `n`-independent) Kolmogorov
distance between the `N(1,1)` and `N(0,1)` distribution functions, so it does not tend to `0`.
The hypothesis is already carried by the downstream sibling
`tendstoInMeasure_supCDFDist_parametric_bootstrap`, so no application is weakened. -/

/-- **Limiting local power of the bootstrap test.**

Test `g(θ) = 0` against `g(θ) > 0` by rejecting when `n^{1/2} g(thHat n)` exceeds the estimated
`1 − α` quantile. Against the contiguous alternatives `θ + n^{-1/2} hdir` the rejection
probability converges to `1 − Φ(z_{1−α} − σ⁻¹ ⟪∇g(θ), hdir⟫)`, where `σ²` is the variance of
the limiting law of the root at `θ`.

**Signature amendment (two `LEAN-ONLY` measurability hypotheses).** The rejection event is the
*complement* of `{n^{1/2} g(thHat n) ≤ ĉₙ}`, and the hypotheses `hlocalCLT`/`hcritval` control
only events of the form `{· ≤ x}` and `{ε ≤ |·|}`. Passing to the complement needs
`measure_compl`, hence measurability of the rejection region: for a non-measurable set `A` the
Mathlib `Measure` is the outer-measure extension and `μ A + μ Aᶜ > μ univ` is possible, so the
complement step is not available without it. The two hypotheses added are the ones the siblings
of this cluster (`tendsto_bootstrapCoverage`, `tendsto_bootstrapTest_level`) already carry, and
they are pure regularity: no probabilistic content is imported. -/
