# Bootstrap hypothesis tests

To turn a test statistic into a test one needs a critical value, and the bootstrap supplies one
by resampling. The essential point is *which* law to resample from: not the empirical measure of
the data, but an estimate `Qhat n` that **satisfies the constraints of the null hypothesis**.
Resampling from the unrestricted empirical measure estimates the distribution of the statistic
under the law that actually generated the data, whether or not it satisfies the null; the
resulting test has asymptotic rejection probability `α` even against alternatives, and so has no
power. Estimating under the null constraints makes the critical value behave, under an
alternative, like the critical value at some null law, against which a divergent statistic
rejects with probability tending to one.

This file contains:

* `MemClassInProbability` — membership of a random sequence of laws in a sequence class, in
  probability;
* `tendsto_bootstrapTest_level` — the rejection probability of the bootstrap test tends to the
  nominal level under the null;
* `tendsto_bootstrapTest_power_one` — the accompanying consistency claim against fixed
  alternatives.

Subsampling Methods), §18.5 (Hypothesis Testing), Theorem 18.5.1 (a bootstrap test has
asymptotic level `α`). (`TSH4 §18.5 Thm 18.5.1`.)

**Designed deviation (metric-free formulation, and its cost here).** The reference states this
result with a metric `d` on laws: smoothness is `d(P_n, P) → 0 ⇒ G_n(·, P_n) ⇒ G(·, P)`, and the
estimator satisfies `d(Qhat n, P) → 0` in probability. We keep this area's sequence-class
formulation instead. The convergence hypothesis translates directly. The *in probability*
hypothesis does not: a sequence class ties the index `n` of the law to the sample size, so one
cannot simply pass to a subsequence of laws and keep the pairing. `MemClassInProbability`
therefore asks that along a further subsequence there exist, almost surely, a class member
**agreeing with the random sequence at those indices** — the index-preserving form of the
"fill in the missing indices with the limit law" device that the metric argument performs
implicitly. Almost sure membership implies it, with the identity subsequence.

**Deviation from the reference hypotheses (strict increase at the quantile).** The reference
assumes only that the limit law `G(·, P)` is continuous. Continuity alone does not give
convergence of the `1 − α` quantiles: a flat stretch of the limit distribution function at
height `1 − α` leaves the quantile undetermined, and the estimated quantiles may then oscillate
across it. The quantile step needs strict increase at that point, exactly as in the confidence
set theory of this area, and we state it explicitly rather than leave it implicit.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* `G` is the distribution function field of the **statistic**, not of a root: it depends on the
  law and on the sample size only, so the critical value is a function of the resampling law
  alone. As everywhere in this area, its distribution function properties are hypotheses and no
  measurability in the measure argument is assumed.
* The test rejects on `{ω | g_n(1 − α, Qhat n ω) < T n ω}` — a strict inequality, matching the
  convention that large values of the statistic are evidence against the null. The rejection
  probability appearing in the conclusions is the size of the nonrandomized critical function of
  that region, in the sense of this area's test vocabulary; the statements are phrased directly
  as measures of the rejection event, so none of that vocabulary is needed here.
* Consistency against fixed alternatives is not part of the numbered result in the reference; it
  is the claim accompanying it, under the additional assumptions that the statistic diverges in
  probability under the alternative and that the estimated critical value stays bounded in
  probability. It is stated separately here to keep that distinction visible.

**Bibliographic comments.** The bootstrap is due to B. Efron ("Bootstrap methods: another look
at the jackknife," *Ann. Statist.* **7** (1979), 1–26). Its use for constructing critical values
of tests, and the requirement that resampling respect the null constraints, are developed by
R. Beran ("Bootstrap methods in statistics," *Jahresber. Deutsch. Math.-Verein.* **86** (1984),
14–30) and J. P. Romano ("A bootstrap revival of some nonparametric distance tests," *J. Amer.
Statist. Assoc.* **83** (1988), 698–708); see also D. N. Politis, J. P. Romano and M. Wolf,
*Subsampling*, Springer, 1999, and P. Hall, *The Bootstrap and Edgeworth Expansion*, Springer,
1992, for the higher-order comparisons.

/-- **Membership of a random sequence of laws in a sequence class, in probability.**

Every subsequence admits a further subsequence along which, almost surely, some member of the
class agrees with the random sequence *at those very indices*. Index preservation is essential:
the classes of this area pair the index of a law with the sample size, so a class member cannot
be produced by reindexing. Almost sure membership is the special case obtained with the identity
subsequence. -/

/-- **Asymptotic level of the bootstrap test.**

The data are generated by a null law `P`. Along every sequence of the null class the sampling
distribution functions of the statistic converge to a common continuous limit, and the
null-restricted estimator lies in the null class in probability. Then the test rejecting when
the statistic exceeds the estimated `1 − α` quantile has rejection probability tending to the
nominal level `α`. -/

/-- **Consistency of the bootstrap test against a fixed alternative.**

Accompanying claim, not part of the level statement above. If under the law generating the data
the statistic diverges in probability, while the estimated critical value stays bounded in
probability — which is what resampling under the null constraints buys — then the rejection
probability tends to one. -/
