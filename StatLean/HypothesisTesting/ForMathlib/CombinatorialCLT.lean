# The combinatorial central limit theorem

Let `d : Fin N → ℝ` be a deterministic coefficient vector and let `a : Fin m → Fin N` pick out
`m` distinct positions. A uniform random permutation `σ` of `Fin N` relabels the positions,
and the **block sum**
$$ B_\sigma \;=\; \sum_{i < m} d\bigl(\sigma(a_i)\bigr) $$
is the sum of a *simple random sample of size `m` without replacement* from the finite
population `{d(1), …, d(N)}`. Every linear permutation statistic — in particular the
two-sample permutation statistic of `Randomization/TwoSamplePermutation` — is an affine
function of such a block sum.

The first two moments are elementary and are proved here from the one- and two-coordinate
marginals of `ForMathlib/PermutationMarginals`: for a **centred** population (`∑ d = 0`),
$$ \mathbb E\, B_\sigma = 0, \qquad
   \mathbb E\, B_\sigma^2 = \frac{m(N-m)}{N(N-1)} \sum_l d(l)^2 . $$
The **combinatorial central limit theorem** of Wald–Wolfowitz, Noether, Hoeffding, Erdős–Rényi
and Hájek says that the standardized block sum is asymptotically standard normal as soon as
both `m` and `N - m` tend to infinity and the population satisfies a Lindeberg-type condition;
that is `tendsto_perm_cdf_blockSum` below.

## Main results

* `sum_perm_inv` — a group average is unchanged by inverting the permutation. (The
  randomization action of `Randomization/TwoSamplePermutation` is `(σ • x) i = x (σ⁻¹ i)`,
  whereas the marginal bricks are written with `σ`; this is the bridge.)
* `avg_perm_blockSum` — the exact first moment of a block sum.
* `avg_perm_blockSum_sq` — the exact second moment of a **centred** block sum, i.e. the
  finite-population variance `m(N-m)/(N(N-1)) · ∑ d²`.
* `perm_avg_indicator_blockAvg_sub_mean_le` and its inverse-convention twin
  `perm_avg_indicator_blockAvg_inv_sub_mean_le` — the Chebyshev step for a block average of
  **uncentred** coefficients against the population mean.
* `avg_measureReal_eq_integral_avg_indicator` — Fubini for a finite group: the group average
  of deviation *probabilities* is the integral of the group average of the *indicators*.
* `blockSumScale` — the asymptotic standard deviation `√(m(N-m)/N)` used to standardize.
* `blockSet`, `SwapIndex`, `stdBlockSum`, `stdBlockSumSwap` — the **exchangeable pair** of
  Stein's method: swap one sampled position with one unsampled position.
* `sum_blockSet_mul_swap` and `stdBlockSumSwap_sub` — the increment of the pair.
* `sum_swap_exchangeable` — the pair is exchangeable.
* `sum_swapIndex_increment` and `sum_swapIndex_increment'` — the linearity condition, exactly,
  with `λ = N/(m(N-m))`.
* `sum_sq_swapIndex_increment` — the **conditional variance** of the pair, exactly:
  `∑ₖ (W' − W)² = u²(m ∑ d² + (N − 2m) A₂(σ) + 2 B(σ)²)`, which reduces the
  variance-regression defect of Stein's method to the concentration of the block sum of
  squares `A₂`; `avg_perm_blockSumSq` and `avg_perm_blockSet_sq` are the two moments that
  identity needs, and `avg_perm_sum_sq_swapIndex_increment` is its group average,
  `u² · 2m(N−m)/(N−1) · ∑ d²` — so at the Stein normalisation the variance-regression term
  is *exactly* centred at `(N−1)⁻¹ ∑ d² → 1`.
* `abs_avg_blockSum_sub_stdGaussianExpect_le` — a **Berry–Esseen-type bound at a fixed
  stage**: the group average of a bounded Lipschitz test function at a standardized block sum
  differs from its Gaussian expectation by an explicit finite-population quantity, a
  variance-regression term (second and fourth moments) plus a third-moment term.
* `tendsto_perm_avg_lipschitz` — the combinatorial CLT tested against bounded Lipschitz
  functions (the core analytic brick; proved from the previous one by truncating the
  population at Hájek's scale and letting the truncation level tend to `0`).
* `tendsto_perm_cdf_blockSum` — **the combinatorial central limit theorem**, derived from the
  previous one by the elementary ramp de-smoothing.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* *Which model.* Sampling without replacement has two equivalent carriers in this
  repository: the **subset** model of `ForMathlib/HypergeometricMoments` (uniform on
  `SubsetsOfCard N m`, average written `expect`) and the **permutation** model of
  `ForMathlib/PermutationMarginals` (uniform on `Equiv.Perm (Fin N)`, average written as an
  explicit normalized sum). This file uses the permutation model, because `randDist` and
  `randPairLaw` are *defined* as averages over the acting group, so no transfer lemma is
  needed at the point of use. The two moment computations below are the permutation-model
  twins of `HypergeometricMoments.expect_weight` and `HypergeometricMoments.var_linear`.
* *No factorial.* As in `PermutationMarginals`, the cardinality of the symmetric group is
  never computed; it cancels against itself through `avg_perm_apply` and
  `avg_perm_apply_pair`.
* *Standardization.* `blockSumScale N m = √(m(N-m)/N)` is the asymptotic standard deviation
  of a block sum whose population is normalized to `N⁻¹ ∑ d² → 1`; the exact standard
  deviation carries the extra finite-population factor `N/(N-1) · (N⁻¹ ∑ d²)`, which tends
  to `1` under the hypotheses of `tendsto_perm_cdf_blockSum` and would only clutter the
  statement. Both `m` and `N - m` are required to tend to infinity, which is necessary: for
  `m` bounded the block sum is a sum of boundedly many terms and has no normal limit, and the
  problem is symmetric under `m ↦ N - m` because `∑ d = 0` makes the two blocks negatives of
  each other.
* *Which Lindeberg condition.* The threshold is `ε √(min m (N-m))`, i.e. Hájek's condition,
  not `ε √N`. The two agree when `m/N` stays bounded away from `0` and `1` — which is the
  two-sample regime `m/n → λ ∈ (0, ∞)` — but Hájek's is the one that is also *necessary*, so
  it is the honest hypothesis to record.

**Bibliographic comments.** The theorem originates with A. Wald and J. Wolfowitz,
"Statistical tests based on permutations of the observations," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **15**
(1944), 358–372, who assumed all moments; G. E. Noether, "On a theorem of Pitman," *Ann.
Math. Statist.* **20** (1949), 455–458, and W. Hoeffding, "A combinatorial central limit
theorem," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **22** (1951), 558–566, reduced the hypotheses to conditions
on the fourth and second moments respectively. The definitive form — a Lindeberg condition
that is both necessary and sufficient for simple random sampling from a finite population —
is due to P. Erdős and A. Rényi, "On the central limit theorem for samples from a finite
population," *Publ. Math. Inst. Hungar. Acad. Sci.* **4** (1959), 49–61, and J. Hájek,
"Limiting distributions in simple random sampling from a finite population," *Publ. Math.
Inst. Hungar. Acad. Sci.* **5** (1960), 361–374. Modern proofs go through Stein's method for
exchangeable pairs (C. Stein, *Approximate Computation of Expectations*, IMS, 1986) or
through a coupling with the conditioned Bernoulli representation.

`Randomization/TwoSamplePermutation` is `(σ • x) i = x (σ⁻¹ i)`, while the marginal bricks of
`ForMathlib/PermutationMarginals` are stated with `σ`; this lemma is the bridge, and it costs
nothing because inversion is a bijection of the group. -/

The `m` diagonal terms contribute `N⁻¹ ∑ d²` each and the `m(m-1)` off-diagonal ones
contribute `-(N(N-1))⁻¹ ∑ d²` each, by the one- and two-coordinate marginals; the negative
sign is the negative correlation forced by sampling without replacement. Both degenerate

/-! ### Chebyshev for a block average, with uncentred coefficients

`PermutationMarginals.perm_avg_indicator_blockAvg_le` is stated for an already-centred
coefficient vector, which is the form in which the variance identity is cleanest. Consumers,
however, arrive with a raw vector `c` — the pooled data, or a function of it — and want to
compare its block average against its *population* average `c̄ = N⁻¹ ∑ c`. Recentring is a
one-line shift, recorded here once so that the studentized-scale arguments do not each
repeat it. -/

/-- **Chebyshev for a block average against the population mean.** Under a uniform random
permutation, the fraction of permutations whose block average of `c` deviates from
`c̄ = N⁻¹ ∑ c` by `ε` is at most `ε⁻² (1/m) (N⁻¹ ∑ (c - c̄)²)` — the population dispersion
divided by the block size, exactly as for sampling with replacement, the finite-population
correction having been discarded. -/

The bounds above are pointwise in the data: they control the group average of an *indicator*

(`TendstoInProbRandomized`, and the `hrem` hypotheses of the Slutsky transfers) are group
averages of *probabilities*. The two are exchanged by Fubini for a finite group, which is
the following identity — the only step needed to turn `perm_avg_indicator_blockAvg_..._le`
into a statement about the data law. -/

/-! ### The exchangeable pair of Stein's method

The modern proof of the combinatorial CLT builds an **exchangeable pair** out of a single
elementary move: pick one sampled position and one unsampled position uniformly at random and
interchange them. The three facts that Stein's method consumes — the increment formula, the
exchangeability, and the exact linearity of the conditional drift — are proved here; they are
all purely combinatorial, and together they instantiate the abstract engine
`ForMathlib/SteinMethod.abs_avg_sub_le` at `Ω = Equiv.Perm (Fin N)` and
`K = SwapIndex a`. -/

/-- **The conditional variance of the swap pair, exactly.** For a *centred* population,
$$ \sum_k \bigl(W'(\sigma,k) - W(\sigma)\bigr)^2
   \;=\; u^2\Bigl( m\sum_l d_l^2 \;+\; (N - 2m)\,A_2(\sigma) \;+\; 2\,B(\sigma)^2 \Bigr), $$
where `A₂(σ) = ∑_{r ∈ blockSet a} d(σ r)²` is the block sum of squares and
`B(σ) = ∑_{r ∈ blockSet a} d(σ r) = u⁻¹ W(σ)` is the block sum itself. Expanding the square
of the increment `u(d(σq) − d(σp))` produces the three terms: the `m(N−m)` cross terms of
`∑_q d(σq)²` and `∑_p d(σp)²` are counted with multiplicities `m` and `N−m`, and the
`-2 ∑_p ∑_q d(σp)d(σq)` term collapses to `+2B(σ)²` because the complement of the block sums
to `-B(σ)`.

This is the identity that turns the variance-regression defect
`𝔼|1 − (2λ)⁻¹ ∑_k (W' − W)²|` of `SteinMethod.abs_avg_sub_le` into a statement about the
concentration of `A₂` alone: with `λ = N/(m(N−m))` and `u² = N/(m(N−m))` one gets
`(2λ)⁻¹∑_k (W' − W)² = ½(m N⁻¹ ∑ d² + (1 − 2m/N) A₂(σ) + 2N⁻¹ B(σ)²)`, and both `B(σ)²/N`
and the deviation of `A₂` from its mean `(m/N)∑d²` are second-order. -/

/-! ### The variance-regression term of the swap pair -/

/-- **The variance-regression term of the swap pair.** With the Stein normalisation
`u² = λ = N/(m(N−m))`, the exact conditional variance `sum_sq_swapIndex_increment` gives
`(2λ)⁻¹ 𝔼[(W'−W)² ∣ σ] = (2m(N−m))⁻¹ (m ∑d² + (N−2m) A₂(σ) + 2 B(σ)²)`, whose group average is
`(N−1)⁻¹ ∑ d²` (`avg_perm_sum_sq_swapIndex_increment`). Subtracting the exact mean leaves two
fluctuations: that of the block sum of squares `A₂`, controlled by Cauchy–Schwarz and the
finite-population variance `avg_perm_blockSum_sq` applied to the *centred squares*
`d² − N⁻¹∑d²` — this is the fourth-moment input `∑ d⁴` — and that of `B²`, which is `O(1/N)`
in mean because `B` is the block sum itself. -/

/-! ### The Berry-Esseen-type bound at a fixed stage -/

/-- **A Berry–Esseen-type bound for a block sum, at a fixed stage.** For a centred population
`d` on `Fin N` and a block of `m` distinct positions, standardized by any `u > 0` with
`u² = N/(m(N−m))`, the group average of a bounded `L`-Lipschitz test function differs from its
standard normal expectation by at most the sum of a *variance-regression* term — the defect of
`(N−1)⁻¹∑d²` from `1` plus a fourth-moment fluctuation — and a *third-moment* term. Both are
explicit finite-population quantities; the asymptotic statement
`tendsto_perm_avg_lipschitz` is obtained by applying this bound to a truncated population. -/

/-! ### Changing the population inside a group average -/

/-- **Replacing the population costs a second moment.** Two *centred* populations `d` and `d'`
give group averages of an `L`-Lipschitz test function that differ by at most
`L u √(m(N−m)/(N(N−1)) ∑ (d − d')²)`; the finite-population factor is the exact second moment
`avg_perm_blockSum_sq` of the difference, and it is what makes the estimate symmetric under
`m ↦ N − m`. This is the step that discards the tail of a truncated population. -/

/-- **The combinatorial central limit theorem, tested against Lipschitz functions** — the
core analytic brick. Under the hypotheses of `tendsto_perm_cdf_blockSum`, the group average
of `h` evaluated at the standardized block sum converges to the standard normal expectation
of `h`, for every bounded Lipschitz `h`.

STATUS (wave 9): PROVED, axiom-clean. Route: Stein's method for exchangeable pairs
(`ForMathlib/SteinMethod`) applied to the **truncated** population, plus a diagonal argument
in the truncation level `ε`.

* the engine `SteinMethod.abs_avg_sub_le` bounds `|avg h(W) − 𝔼h(Z)|` by
  `B₁ · avg|1 − V/(2λ)| + B₂/(4λ) · avg|W' − W|³` for any exchangeable pair with
  `𝔼[W' − W ∣ σ] = -λ W`, with `B₁ = 2L` (`SteinMethod.abs_deriv_steinSolution_le`) and
  `B₂ = 5L` (`SteinMethod.lipschitz_deriv_steinSolution`);
* the pair is the swap pair of the section above: `Ω = Equiv.Perm (Fin (N k))`,
  `K = SwapIndex (a k)`, `W = stdBlockSum`, `W' = stdBlockSumSwap`, with exchangeability
  (`sum_swap_exchangeable`), the linearity condition with `λ = N/(m(N−m))`
  (`sum_swapIndex_increment'`) and the exact conditional variance
  (`sum_sq_swapIndex_increment`);
* the two moment estimates for this pair are `avg_cube_increment_le` (third moment, from the
  one-coordinate marginal only) and `avg_abs_one_sub_condSq_le` (variance regression, from
  Cauchy–Schwarz and the exact second moment `avg_perm_blockSum_sq` applied to the *centred
  squares* `d² − N⁻¹∑d²`, i.e. a fourth-moment input `∑ d⁴`). Together they give the
  fixed-stage Berry–Esseen-type bound `abs_avg_blockSum_sub_stdGaussianExpect_le`;
* the truncation is `truncCentred (ε√(min (m, N−m)))`: the kept part is bounded by the
  Lindeberg scale, and the recentring shift by `abs_mean_truncKeep_le`. The discarded part
  is paid for by `abs_avg_h_blockSum_sub_le`, which costs *one exact second moment* of the
  difference — with the finite-population factor `m(N−m)/(N(N−1))`, which is what makes the
  estimate symmetric under `m ↦ N − m` (a Chebyshev bound without that factor is not);
* `abs_avg_blockSum_sub_le_of_trunc` is the `ε`-step, and `tendsto_of_eventually_abs_sub_le`
  performs the diagonal argument. The two comparisons `mul_div_add_le_min` and
  `min_div_two_le_mul_div` — `min(m,N−m)/2 ≤ m(N−m)/N ≤ min(m,N−m)` — are what convert the
  Stein scale `√(m(N−m)/N)` into Hájek's scale `√(min (m, N−m))` at both error terms.

WARNING (wave 8, and the reason for the truncation). It is not merely that a naive bound on
the third moment fails: the raw third-moment error term of `abs_avg_sub_le`, applied to the
*untruncated* pair, can itself **diverge** under the hypotheses of this theorem, so any
reduction of this statement to "the two error terms of the raw swap pair tend to `0`" is a
reduction to something FALSE. Explicit witness: take `m k = ⌈log N⌉`, two coefficients
`d₁ = -d₂ = √N / log log N` and the remaining `N − 2` coefficients `±1`, balanced. Then
`∑ d = 0`, `N⁻¹∑d² → 1`, and for every `ε > 0` the Hájek–Lindeberg sum is eventually
`2 (log log N)^{-2} → 0` (only `d₁, d₂` exceed the threshold `ε√(log N)`), so all hypotheses
hold; yet, since `λ⁻¹ 𝔼|W' − W|³ ≍ N⁻¹∑|d|³ / √(m(N−m)/N)`,
`≍ √N (log log N)^{-3} / √(log N) → ∞`. After truncation at the Lindeberg scale one has
`N⁻¹∑|d|³ ≤ ε√(min(m, N−m)) · N⁻¹∑d²`, which is `O(ε)` after dividing by the scale. -/

/-- **The combinatorial central limit theorem** (Wald–Wolfowitz, Noether, Hoeffding,
Erdős–Rényi, Hájek). Let `d k` be a centred population on `Fin (N k)` with normalized second
moment tending to `1`, and let `a k` sample `m k` distinct positions. If both block sizes
`m k` and `N k - m k` tend to infinity and the populations satisfy Hájek's Lindeberg
condition at scale `√(min (m k) (N k - m k))`, then the block sum standardized by
`blockSumScale` is asymptotically standard normal — stated here in the group-average
c.d.f. form in which randomization distributions are defined.

STATUS (wave 7): DISCHARGED to the single core brick `tendsto_perm_avg_lipschitz` below —
the same theorem tested against *Lipschitz* functions instead of a half-line indicator. The
de-smoothing step performed here is the elementary one: the indicator of `Iic t` is squeezed
between two ramps of width `ε` (`ForMathlib/EsseenSmoothing.ramp`), the ramps are `ε⁻¹`-
Lipschitz and bounded by `1`, their Gaussian expectations bracket `Φ(t ∓ ε)`, and `Φ` is
1-Lipschitz (`ForMathlib/SteinMethod.lipschitzWith_cdf_gaussianReal`), hence continuous, so
letting `ε → 0` costs nothing. -/
