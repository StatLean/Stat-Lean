# Randomized tests as Markov kernels — ForMathlib brick

A randomized test is carried in the testing theory as a **critical function** `φ : 𝓧 → ℝ`
with values in `[0,1]`: on observing `x` one rejects with probability `φ(x)`. The
decision-theoretic machinery instead quantifies over **Markov kernels** `𝓧 ⇝ Fin 2` (the
randomized `{accept, reject}` decision rules). This file builds the bridge:

* `randomizedTestKernel φ hφ` — the kernel sending `x` to the Bernoulli law
  `φ(x) δ₁ + (1 − φ(x)) δ₀` on `Fin 2`;
* its singleton masses, the Markov property under `0 ≤ φ ≤ 1`, and the integral formula
  `∫⁻ f d(randomizedTestKernel φ hφ x) = φ(x)·f(1) + (1 − φ(x))·f(0)`.

Theorem-agnostic and Mathlib-only: nothing here mentions models, levels or power.

**Reference.** Classical randomized-test formulation; original sources in the bibliographic
comments below.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The Bernoulli weights are `ENNReal.ofReal (φ x)` and `ENNReal.ofReal (1 − φ x)`, which makes
  the definition total: off the range `0 ≤ φ ≤ 1` the two weights simply fail to sum to `1`
  and the kernel is sub- or super-probabilistic. `isMarkovKernel_randomizedTestKernel` is the
  single place where the range condition is consumed, and it is stated with the two bare
  inequalities rather than the concept-layer critical-function predicate: this file sits in
  the bottom (Mathlib-only) layer and must not import the concept layer.
* Measurability of the kernel is checked through `Measure.measurable_of_measurable_coe` on the
  explicit two-atom formula. The minimax area builds an `ℝ≥0∞`-valued binary test the same
  way; the two are deliberately kept separate (that one is private and takes an `ℝ≥0∞`
  acceptance function, this one the `[0,1]`-real-valued critical function of testing theory).
* `Fin 2` has `MeasurableSingletonClass`, so `lintegral_randomizedTestKernel` needs no
  measurability hypothesis on the integrand.

**Bibliographic comments.** Randomized tests and their critical functions are due to
J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson ("On the problem of the most efficient tests of statistical
hypotheses," *Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A* **231** (1933), 289–337). Reading a randomized decision
rule as a Markov kernel from the sample space to the action space is due to A. Wald
(*Statistical Decision Functions*, Wiley, 1950).
