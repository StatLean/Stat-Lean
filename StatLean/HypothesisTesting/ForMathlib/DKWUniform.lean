# A uniform-in-`n` exponential tail for the empirical process

For an i.i.d. real sample `X₁, …, Xₙ` with law `μ` and distribution function `F`, the
Kolmogorov distance between the empirical and the population distribution function,
$$D_n \;=\; \sup_{t \in \mathbb R}\bigl|\hat F_n(t) - F(t)\bigr| ,$$
satisfies an exponential tail bound *with constants free of `n` and of `μ`*:
$$\mathbb P\bigl(\sqrt n\, D_n \ge d\bigr) \;\le\; C\,e^{-c\,d^2}
  \qquad (d \ge 0).$$
This is the finite-sample input needed to calibrate a distribution-free goodness-of-fit
test at a fixed threshold, without ever invoking the Kolmogorov limit law: a rejection
threshold `d_α` with `C e^{-c d_α²} ≤ α` gives a test of level `α` at *every* sample size.

## Main results

* `empCDF`, `ksDist` — the empirical distribution function of a finite sample and its
  Kolmogorov distance to a population law.
* `integral_ksDist_le` — the in-expectation bound `E Dₙ ≤ 2/√n`.
* `ksDist_concentration` — bounded-differences concentration of `Dₙ` around its mean.
* `dkw_uniform` — the tail bound, `P(√n Dₙ ≥ d) ≤ 4 e^{-d²/8}`.

**Constants (documented deviation).** The sharp form of this inequality has the constants
`C = 2`, `c = 2`, and those are *not* what the route formalised here delivers. We state the
strictly weaker `C = 4`, `c = 1/16`, which is exactly what the two ingredients below compose
to and which is implied by the sharp form, so the statement is true. Concretely:

* the mean bound `integral_ksDist_le` is proved at `√n · E Dₙ ≤ 4` (the true value is
  `≈ 0.87`, the mean of the Kolmogorov limit law `sup|B°|`), and
* the bounded-differences bound `ksDist_concentration` gives `exp(−2(d − 4)²)` for `d ≥ 4`.

Composing the two: `min_d [2(d − M)² − c d²] = −2cM²/(2 − c)`, so with `M = 4` the pair
`(C, c) = (4, 1/16)` is admissible as soon as `2 · 16 · c/(2 − c) ≤ log 4`, i.e. `c ≤ 0.083`;
at `c = 1/16` the left side is `1.032 ≤ log 4 = 1.386`, with slack. (The sharp arithmetic
constant is `32/31`, attained at `d = 128/31`; this is the numeral in the `dkw_uniform`
proof.) For `d ≤ 4√(log 4) = 4.709…` the envelope `4 e^{−d²/16}` exceeds `1` and the bound
is vacuous — in particular it covers the whole range `d ≤ 4` where the mean bound leaves
nothing to prove.

**Deviation from the frozen statement, and the coordinated edit it forced.** The frozen
statements were `√n · E Dₙ ≤ 2` and `4 e^{−d²/8}`. The mean constant `2` is *not* reachable
by any elementary route (see items 1–7 below); the route that is executable lands at `4`,
and `M = 4` provably breaks the frozen headline — `max_d [d²/8 − 2(d − 4)²] = 32/15 = 2.133 >
log 4 = 1.386` (at `d = 64/15`), while the vacuous regime of `4 e^{−d²/8}` only reaches
`d = √(8 log 4) = 3.330 < 4`, so the band `d ∈ (3.330, 4)` would be covered by neither
regime. Per the charter rule *state the constants that are actually provable*, the two
statements were amended to `4/√n` and `4 e^{−d²/16}`, and the single downstream consumer of
`c`, the numeral inside `ksThreshold` in `GoodnessOfFit/KSConsistency.lean`, was changed from
`√(8 log(4/α))` to `√(16 log(4/α))` (the deviation is recorded at that definition too).
Every statement in `KSConsistency.lean` and `KSLocalPower.lean` is phrased through
`ksThreshold` and re-derives its level from the defining equation `4 e^{−s²/16} = α`, so no
other edit was required: the calibrated thresholds are `√2` times larger, i.e. the tests are
more conservative, and all four headline theorems there hold verbatim.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The empirical distribution function is defined locally, as a plain average of indicators,
  rather than imported: this file sits in the bottom (`ForMathlib`) layer and must not
  depend on another area's concept layer.
* `ksDist` is an unrestricted real supremum over `t : ℝ`. Both `t ↦ empCDF X ω t` and the
  population `cdf μ` are right-continuous, so the supremum over `ℝ` coincides with the
  supremum over `ℚ`; that identity (a deterministic, pointwise statement) is what makes the
  event measurable and is the standard first step of the proof. The supremum is bounded by
  `1`, so no junk value of `⨆` is ever hit for `n ≥ 1`.
* `ksDist_concentration` is the bounded-differences inequality applied to
  `f(x₁,…,xₙ) = supₜ |n⁻¹ ∑ᵢ 1{xᵢ ≤ t} − F(t)|`, which changes by at most `1/n` when one
  coordinate is changed; with `cᵢ = 1/n` the bound `exp(-2s²/∑cᵢ²) = exp(-2ns²)` at
  `s = d/√n` is `exp(-2d²)`. The project's McDiarmid theorem
  (`StatLean.ConcentrationInequalities.McDiarmid`) is the engine.
* Events are stated with a closed inequality `d ≤ …`; this is the stronger form and the
  underlying sub-Gaussian Chernoff bound supplies it directly.

**Mean bound: how `integral_ksDist_le` is proved, and why the constant is `4`.**

1. *How much slack does the headline allow at a fixed `c`?* `dkw_uniform` composes a mean
   bound `√n · E Dₙ ≤ M` with the tail `exp(−2(d − M)²)`. Since
   `min_d [2(d − M)² − c d²] = −2cM²/(2 − c)`, the composition yields
   `P(√n Dₙ ≥ d) ≤ exp(2cM²/(2 − c)) · e^{−c d²}` for **every** `d ≥ 0`. At the frozen
   `c = 1/8` the headline `C = 4` survives only `M ≤ √(15 log 4/2) = 3.2245`; at the amended
   `c = 1/16` it survives every `M ≤ √(31 log 4/2) = 4.635`, so `M = 4` fits.

2. *Grid + union bound cannot give any constant.* With the quantile grid `t₁ < … < t_m`,
   monotonicity gives `Dₙ ≤ max_j |Δ(t_j)| + 1/m`, and each `Δ(t_j)` is `1/(4n)`-sub-Gaussian,
   so `E max_j |Δ(t_j)| ≤ √(log(2m)/(2n))` and
   `√n E Dₙ ≤ √(log(2m)/2) + √n/m`. Every choice of `m` leaves `√(log(2m)/2) ≥ √(log(2√n)/2)`,
   which diverges. The `√(log n)` factor is intrinsic to a *single-scale* union bound; only
   chaining or a martingale argument removes it.

3. *Generic VC chaining is available but too lossy.* `ConcentrationInequalities.glivenko_cantelli`
   bounds exactly this integrand by `5400/√n` (generic VC bound at `vcDim = 1`, for an i.i.d.
   *stream* `X : ℕ → Ξ → ℝ`; the finite sample here would first have to be transported to the
   canonical infinite product). By (1) that constant forces `c ≈ 4.8 · 10⁻⁸`, i.e. a
   statistically useless calibration, so it is not the route taken.

4. *The route actually formalised* (`M = 4`). Symmetrisation gives
   `E Dₙ ≤ 2 E supₜ |n⁻¹ ∑ᵢ εᵢ 1{Xᵢ ≤ t}|` with `ε` Rademacher and independent of `X`
   (`ConcentrationInequalities.empirical_symmetrization_countable`, instantiated at the
   countable class of half-lines `{x ≤ q}`, `q ∈ ℚ`; the reduction of the `ℝ`-supremum to the
   `ℚ`-supremum is `dkw_iSup_real_eq_iSup_rat`). **Conditionally on `X`, that supremum is
   exactly the maximum of a ±1 random walk**: as `t` sweeps `ℝ`, the index set `{i : Xᵢ ≤ t}`
   runs precisely through the prefixes of the sorted sample, so
   `supₜ |∑ᵢ εᵢ 1{Xᵢ ≤ t}| = max_{0 ≤ j ≤ n} |Sⱼ|` (`exists_dkwWalk_eq`, via `Tuple.sort` and
   the fact that a downward-closed subset of `Fin n` is an initial segment). Finally
   `E max_j |Sⱼ| ≤ 2 E|Sₙ| ≤ 2√n` (`integral_dkwMax_le`), whence `√n · E Dₙ ≤ 4`.

5. *The maximal step, in the form used here.* Rather than Doob's `L^p` inequality (absent from
   Mathlib at v4.29.1) the proof uses **Lévy's maximal inequality**
   `P(max_{j ≤ n} |Sⱼ| ≥ a) ≤ 2 P(|Sₙ| ≥ a)` (`dkw_levy`), proved by reflecting the increments
   after the first passage time: the reflection is the coordinatewise sign flip
   `s ↦ (c_j(i) · s_i)_i` with `c_j = 1` on the first `j` steps and `−1` after, and it preserves
   the sign law by `signVec_map_mul_pm`. The first-passage sets are invariant under it, and
   `|Sₙ| + |2Sⱼ − Sₙ| ≥ 2|Sⱼ| ≥ 2a` puts one of the two configurations in `{|Sₙ| ≥ a}`.
   The layer-cake formula (`lintegral_eq_lintegral_meas_le`) then turns this into
   `E max_j |Sⱼ| ≤ 2 E|Sₙ|`, and `E|Sₙ| ≤ √n` follows from `E Sₙ² = n` by the elementary
   `|x| ≤ (x² + c²)/(2c)` at `c = √n` (no Cauchy–Schwarz or `Lᵖ` interpolation needed).

6. *Why `4` and not less.* Inside this route the constant is not repairable: combining *every*
   elementary tail available for the `±1` walk — Kolmogorov `P ≤ n/a²`, Lévy plus Hoeffding
   `P ≤ 4e^{−a²/2n}`, and the trivial `P ≤ 1` — gives
   `E max_j |Sⱼ| ≤ ∫₀^∞ min(1, n/a², 4e^{−a²/2n}) da = 1.66185…·√n`, i.e. `M ≤ 3.3237`, still
   above the frozen `c = 1/8` budget `3.2245` of item (1); adding the fourth moment makes it
   worse (`1.7314·√n`). Only the exact reflection value `E max_j Sⱼ = E|Sₙ| = √(2n/π)(1+o(1))`,
   giving `M = 4√(2/π) = 3.19154`, crosses that line — the miss survives every standard
   refinement, so it is the *method*, not the bookkeeping, that is short. Hence the constant
   was amended rather than the route re-engineered.

7. *What would restore `c = 1/8`.* Under the quantile transform `u = F(t)` the empirical process
   `α(u) = ∑ᵢ (1{Uᵢ ≤ u} − u)` satisfies `E[α(u₂) ∣ ℱ_{u₁}] = ((1−u₂)/(1−u₁)) α(u₁)`, i.e.
   `M(u) := α(u)/(1−u)` is a **martingale** in `u`; hence `exp(θM)` is a submartingale, and
   Doob plus Hoeffding's mgf bound give `P(sup_{u ≤ 1/2} α ≥ x√n) ≤ e^{−x²/2}`. Four such pieces
   give `P(√n Dₙ > x) ≤ 4 e^{−x²/2}` and so `√n E Dₙ ≤ √(2 log 4) + 4∫_{√(2 log 4)}^∞ e^{−x²/2} dx
   ≤ 2.27`, inside the `c = 1/8` budget. Formalising it needs the martingale property of the
   empirical process along a countable dense set of levels (a discrete-time martingale for each
   finite grid, then monotone convergence), which is a self-contained project the repository does
   not have. It remains the only way back to the frozen exponent.

/-- **Concentration of the Kolmogorov distance around its mean.**
Changing one observation moves `Dₙ` by at most `1/n`, so the bounded-differences inequality
with constants `cᵢ = 1/n` gives, for `d ≥ 0`,
`P(√n (Dₙ − E Dₙ) ≥ d) ≤ exp(−2 d²)`.

Only independence of the observations is used here; they need not be identically
distributed, and no property of `μ` enters. -/

/-- **Uniform exponential tail for the empirical process.**
For an i.i.d. sample of size `n ≥ 1` from any law `μ` and any `d ≥ 0`,
$$\mathbb P\bigl(\sqrt n \sup_t |\hat F_n(t) - F(t)| \ge d\bigr) \;\le\; 4\,e^{-d^2/16} .$$
The constants are absolute: they depend neither on `n` nor on `μ`, which is what makes a
fixed rejection threshold distribution-free and valid at every sample size.

Obtained by composing `integral_ksDist_le` (`√n · E Dₙ ≤ 4`) with `ksDist_concentration`;
see the file header for the arithmetic and for the (documented) gap to the sharp constants
