# Finite group actions: orbit averaging and the invariant σ-algebra — ForMathlib brick

Let a **finite** group `G` act measurably on `𝓧`. Averaging a function along the orbits,
$$ (A_G f)(x) \;=\; \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G} f(g\cdot x), $$
produces an invariant function; if the underlying measure is `G`-invariant, this average is
*exactly* the conditional expectation of `f` given the σ-algebra of invariant sets. That
identity is what turns an invariance reduction into a conditioning argument (and, in the other
direction, an averaging argument into a statement about invariant tests).

This file provides:

* `IsInvariantSet G A` and `invariantSets G 𝓧` — the invariant sets, and the closure
  properties that make them a σ-algebra;
* `groupAverage G f` — the orbit average, with its invariance, measurability, and the
  measure-preserving identity `∫ A_G f dμ = ∫ f dμ`;
* `condExp_eq_groupAverage` — the conditional-expectation identity above.

**Carrier note (deliberate fallback).** The invariant sets are packaged as a *set of sets*,
`invariantSets G 𝓧`, together with the three closure lemmas (`empty`, `compl`, `iUnion`) that
would constitute a `MeasurableSpace` instance, rather than as such an instance. The
conditional-expectation statement therefore takes the invariant σ-algebra `m` as a parameter
plus the hypothesis `hm_inv` characterizing its measurable sets, which is exactly what a later
bundling would supply. This keeps the bottom layer free of a data model that the concept layer
may want to shape differently, and costs the consumer one hypothesis: a concept-layer
`MeasurableSpace` whose `MeasurableSet'` field is the conjunction "measurable and fixed by
every group element" discharges `hm_inv` by `fun _ => Iff.rfl`.

**Naming note.** The concept layer of this area already carries the same formula under the name
`orbitAverage` (invariant-test data model). The two live in one namespace, so this brick uses
`groupAverage`; the intended end state is for the concept-layer name to abbreviate this one,
which the bottom layer cannot arrange itself (it must not import the concept layer).

Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2022 (ISBN 978-3-030-70577-0), Chapter 6 (Invariance), §6.3
(Uniformly Most Powerful Invariant Tests), supporting material for Theorem 6.3.1: orbit
averaging under a finite group action and the invariant σ-algebra. (`TSH4 §6.3 Thm 6.3.1`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* Measurability of the action is never an instance here: each statement that needs it takes
  `hmeas : ∀ g : G, Measurable (fun x : 𝓧 => g • x)` explicitly, so the file imposes no
  `MeasurableSMul` requirement on its consumers.
* `groupAverage_smul` is pure reindexing (`g ↦ h * g` is a bijection of `G`) and needs no
  measure-theoretic input; invariance of `μ` enters only in `integral_groupAverage` and
  `condExp_eq_groupAverage`.
* Intended route for `condExp_eq_groupAverage`: `groupAverage G f` is invariant, hence
  `m`-measurable via `hm_inv` and `preimage_mem_invariantSets`; and for `A ∈ m` invariance of
  `A` plus invariance of `μ` gives `∫_A f (g · x) dμ = ∫_A f dμ` for every `g`, so averaging
  over `g` matches the defining property of the conditional expectation. `IsFiniteMeasure μ`
  supplies the σ-finiteness of the trimmed measure that `condExp` requires; `hm ≤ m𝓧` is not a
  hypothesis, being forced by `hm_inv`.

**Bibliographic comments.** Invariance as a reduction principle for testing problems is due to
G. A. Hunt and C. Stein ("Most stringent tests of statistical hypotheses," unpublished, 1946).
The identification of the conditional expectation given the invariant σ-algebra with an orbit
average is the finite-group case of the mean ergodic theorem (J. von Neumann, "Proof of the
quasi-ergodic hypothesis," *Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA* **18** (1932), 70–82;
G. D. Birkhoff, "Proof of the ergodic theorem," *ibid.*, 656–660).
