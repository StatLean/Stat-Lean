# A multivariate Berry–Esseen bound via Lindeberg swapping (honest, non-sharp)

This file develops the elementary "smooth the indicator + Lindeberg swap" route to a
multivariate Berry–Esseen bound, as suggested for
`StatLean.HypothesisTesting.GoodnessOfFit.SmoothTestLargeK`. The two statements quoted
there, `bentkus_berry_esseen_convex` (constant `400 k^{1/4}`) and
`bentkus_berry_esseen_ball` (dimension-free `C`), are **Bentkus (2003)**: a sharp,
research-level dimension factor obtained by Fourier analysis over convex bodies. Their sharp
`β/√n` *rate* is not reproduced here; what is proved here is the honest elementary rate
`(β/√n)^{1/4}`, over balls (`berryEsseen_ball_elementary`, which discharges
`bentkus_berry_esseen_ball`) and over convex sets (`berryEsseen_convex_elementary`) — and, over
convex sets, the strictly better `(β/√n)^{1/2}` of `berryEsseen_convex_improved`, obtained by
the Cameron–Martin route of the wave-13/16 sections at the end of the file.

What this file records instead is the strongest bound the elementary route yields *honestly*.
The single ingredient that is proved unconditionally and is genuinely dimension-free is the
**Gaussian slab (half-space) anti-concentration** bound:

`gaussian_slab_measure_le` — for a unit vector `u` and `a ≤ b`,
`N(0, I_k)({z : a < ⟪u,z⟫ ≤ b}) ≤ (b - a) / √(2π)`,

whose constant `1/√(2π)` carries **no dimension factor at all**. This is "step 3" of the
route for a half-space, and it is the one-dimensional marginal statement: the projection
`z ↦ ⟪u,z⟫` of `N(0,I_k)` is exactly `N(0,1)`, whose density is bounded by `1/√(2π)`.

## Honest accounting of the elementary route (see the module docstring below for the report)

For the **ball** route the elementary programme is now **complete**: `berryEsseen_ball_elementary`
is proved outright and is axiom-clean (it depends on no `sorry`, direct or transitive). Every
ingredient is proved here unconditionally, each with a dimension-free constant:

* `gaussian_slab_measure_le` — slab anti-concentration (`1/√(2π)`);
* `gaussian_ball_shell_measure_le` — *shell* anti-concentration (`C_ac = 7`), resting on the
  uniform chi-density peak bound `chiSquared_density_mul_sqrt_le`, which is obtained **without
  any Stirling asymptotics for `Γ`** by restricting Euler's integral to the length-`√p` window
  at the peak (`le_Gamma_add_half`);
* `norm_taylor_remainder_three_le` — the third-order Taylor remainder on a normed space
  (Mathlib v4.29.1 has only the one-dimensional version, so this is reduced to a segment);
* `exists_smoothed_radial_indicator` — the smoothed radial indicator with an absolute
  third-derivative constant, built by composing a fixed 1-D cutoff with `‖·‖²` (**not** with
  `‖·‖`), which avoids the quantitative iterated-derivative bounds for the Euclidean norm that
  Mathlib does not have.

* `map_normalized_sum_stdGaussian` — Gaussian stability of the normalized sum,
  `(⨂ⁿ N(0,I_k)).map (n^{-1/2} ∑) = N(0,I_k)`, the right-hand endpoint of the Lindeberg
  telescope. Proved by characteristic functions (`Measure.ext_of_charFun` plus the product
  factorization `charFun_map_const_smul_sum`), not by iterated convolution;
* `abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_le` — the third-order multivariate **Lindeberg swap**: the
  hybrid telescope `Qⱼ = ⨂ᵢ (if i < j then γ else ν)`, each step isolated by
  `integral_pi_sum_peel` (`measurePreserving_piFinSuccAbove` + Fubini) and compared by
  `abs_integral_swap_step_le`. The one-step comparison is a second-order Taylor expansion in
  which the linear term dies by Riesz representation plus `hmean`
  (`integral_clm_eq_zero_of_centred`), the quadratic term takes the *same* value on both sides
  because both laws have identity covariance (`integral_bilin_eq_basis_sum` — note it never
  needs the value of that basis sum, only that it is the same one), and the remainder is
  `norm_taylor_remainder_three_le`.

With the Gaussian third moment `β_G ≤ 2 k^{3/2}` (`integral_norm_cube_gaussian_le`, from the two
public χ² moments) these suffice and the ball assembly closes.

The *convex* route is **now complete as well**: `berryEsseen_convex_elementary` is proved
outright and is axiom-clean. Its two ingredients are

* `exists_smoothed_convex_indicator` — the smoothed convex indicator (mollification by a
  `ContDiffBump`, dimension-dependent constant); see its docstring for the construction and the
  section preceding it for the `precompR` tower. With the Lindeberg swap it gives
  `berryEsseen_convex_levy_elementary`, the Lévy/Prokhorov form
  `μₙ(B) ≤ γ(Bᵋ) + C (β/√n)/ε³` (and its mirror image);
* the Gaussian **boundary-shell** bound `γ(Bᵋ) ≤ γ(B) + C_k ε` for convex `B`, together with its
  erosion twin `γ(B) ≤ γ(B₋ᵋ) + C_k ε`. These are `gaussian_thickening_le` and
  `gaussian_le_erosion_add` of `StatLean.HypothesisTesting.ForMathlib.GaussianShell`, proved
  there elementarily (convex slice + supporting hyperplane + `2k` coordinate shifts) with the
  explicit constant `C_k = 4 e² √k` (wave 22; the wave-3 coordinate cover gave the factor-`k`
  worse `8 k^{3/2}/√(2π)`). Ball's Gaussian-surface-area theorem gives the
  sharp `4 k^{1/4}` — exactly the dimension factor of Bentkus's constant — but the assembly
  needs only finiteness of `C_k` at fixed `k`.

With `ε` optimised in `ε^{-3} β/√n + C_k ε` the assembled bound is `(β/√n)^{1/4} = n^{-1/8}`.

## Wave-13 amendment: the exponent `1/4` is **not** intrinsic; the elementary ceiling is `1/2`

Earlier notes in this file (and in `SmoothTestLargeK`) asserted that the balance
`ε^{-3} β/√n + C_k ε` "cannot do better whatever the shell constant is, so the gap is the rate".
The arithmetic is right *for that balance*, but the conclusion is wrong: the balance itself is
not forced. Re-derivation, from scratch:

* In the hybrid telescope the `j`-th step compares `ν` with `γ` inside a background whose first
  `j` coordinates are **already Gaussian**. That background therefore contains an independent
  `N(0,(j/n) I_k)` summand: the test function seen by step `j` is automatically mollified at
  scale `σⱼ = √(j/n)`, for free.
* For a Gaussian mollification the third-order Lindeberg remainder does **not** cost
  `‖D³f‖_∞`. Writing the shift as a Cameron–Martin tilt,
  `∫ f(z + a) dγ(z) = ∫ f(z) exp(⟪a,z⟫ − ‖a‖²/2) dγ(z)`
  (`integral_gaussian_shift_eq_tilt`), the expansion parameter is the *density*, not the test
  function. The tilt's second-order Taylor remainder is `O(‖a‖³)` in `L¹(γ)` with an **absolute,
  dimension-free** constant (`exists_tiltRemainder_bound`, `integral_abs_vecTiltRemainder_le`),
  and its zeroth/first/second-order terms take the same value for *any two* centred
  identity-covariance laws (`tiltPoly_fubini`) — the exact analogue of the classical
  cancellation, but for the Cameron–Martin expansion. With `a = (c/σⱼ) • y` and `c = n^{-1/2}`,
  step `j` costs `C (c/σⱼ)³ (β + β_G) = C (β + β_G) j^{-3/2}` in place of
  `(‖D³f‖_∞/6) c³ (β + β_G)`. This is `abs_integral_gaussian_smoothed_swap_le`, proved below.
* Taking at each step the *better* of the two bounds, the telescope costs
  `(β + β_G) · Σ_{j<n} min(A ε^{-3} n^{-3/2}, j^{-3/2})`. With `θ := A ε^{-3} n^{-3/2}` the sum
  splits at `j* = θ^{-2/3}` into `j* θ = θ^{1/3}` and `Σ_{j ≥ j*} j^{-3/2} ≤ 3 θ^{1/3}`, so the
  total is `≤ 4 (A)^{1/3} (β + β_G)/(ε √n)`: the factor `ε^{-3}` has become `ε^{-1}`.
* The balance is therefore `ε^{-1} β/√n + C_k ε`, minimised at `ε ∼ (β/√n)^{1/2}`, giving
  `|μₙ(B) − γ(B)| ≲ √(C_k) · (β/√n)^{1/2} = O(n^{-1/4})` — a strict improvement on `n^{-1/8}`,
  with the dimension entering only through `√(C_k)`.

**Why `1/2` and not `1`.** The remaining loss is that the swap error is bounded *globally*,
whereas `D³` of a mollified indicator is supported on the `ε`-shell of `∂B`. Localising costs a
factor `P(hybrid ∈ shell)`, which requires the anti-concentration bound for the **hybrid** laws,
not just for `γ`; that is a self-improving induction over `n` (`Δ ≤ A ε^{-3} δ (C_k ε + 2Δ) +
C_k ε`, which closes at `Δ ≲ C_k δ^{1/3}` and, iterated with the Gaussian smoothing above, at
the sharp rate). That induction is Bentkus's actual argument; its two ingredients are proved in
wave 19 (see the amendment below), its probabilistic assembly is not. So the honest ceiling of
the *non-inductive* elementary route is `(β/√n)^{1/2}`, and the residual gap to Bentkus is a
further factor `(β/√n)^{1/2}`.

**Status of the improvement (wave 16: COMPLETE, `0`-sorry and axiom-clean).** The improved
headline is

`berryEsseen_convex_improved` — `|μₙ(B) − γ(B)| ≤ C (β/√n)^{1/2} = O(n^{-1/4})` for measurable
convex `B`, with `C = C₀ + gaussianShellConst k`,

together with its Lévy/thickening form `berryEsseen_convex_levy_improved`
(`μₙ(B) ≤ γ(Bᵋ) + C (β/√n)/ε` and its mirror image — note the mollifier cost `ε^{-1}`, not
`ε^{-3}`) and the **ball** version `berryEsseen_ball_improved`, which keeps the dimension-free
constant of `berryEsseen_ball_elementary` at the better exponent. The proved
`berryEsseen_convex_elementary` and `berryEsseen_ball_elementary` are deliberately left
untouched: they are separate, weaker statements with existing consumers, and nothing about them
is retracted (the ball assembly is now shared: `berryEsseen_ball_of_swap` is `ε`-generic and
takes the swap estimate as a hypothesis, so the two exponents differ only in which swap is fed
to it). The ingredients:

* *Analytic core.* `exists_tiltRemainder_bound` (scalar, absolute constant),
  `integral_abs_vecTiltRemainder_le` (multivariate, **dimension-free**, by reduction to the
  one-dimensional marginal), `integral_gaussian_shift_eq_tilt` (Cameron–Martin),
  `tiltPoly_fubini` (the moment cancellation) and, assembling these,
  `abs_integral_gaussian_smoothed_swap_le` — the swap step at cost `C (c/σ)³ (β_ν + β_ρ)`.
* *Assembly brick (ii).* `map_stdGaussian_pair_smul_add` / `integral_gaussian_pair_smul_add`:
  the Gaussian convolution `γ_σ ∗ γ_c = γ_{√(σ²+c²)}`, in measure and in integral form.
* *Assembly brick (iii).* `sum_le_of_bounded_and_decay`: if `0 ≤ T j ≤ θ` and
  `T j ≤ j^{-3/2}` for `j ≥ 1` then `Σ_{j<n} T j ≤ J θ + 3/√J` for every cut `J ≥ 2` — the
  displayed sum estimate, proved by the backward telescoping bound
  `inv_mul_sqrt_le_telescope` (`j^{-3/2} ≤ 2((j−1)^{-1/2} − j^{-1/2})`), with no integral
  comparison. Choosing `J ≈ θ^{-2/3}` gives `O(θ^{1/3})`.

* *Assembly brick (i) — the telescope itself* (wave 16): `abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_improved`.
  `Iⱼ = ∫ x, (∫ z, f (n^{-1/2} • (∑ₗ xₗ) + (j/n)^{1/2} • z) dγ(z)) d(Measure.pi κ'ⱼ)` with
  `κ'ⱼ i = if i < j then Measure.dirac 0 else ν`. `integral_pi_sum_peel` peels coordinate `j`
  verbatim (the integrand is a bounded continuous function of `∑ₗ xₗ`; its continuity is
  `continuous_integral_add_smul`, dominated convergence with the constant bound `1`). Brick (ii)
  identifies the `(j+1)`-st smoothing with the `j`-th plus one fresh `n^{-1/2}`-scaled Gaussian,
  so *the same single step* both kills a coordinate and widens the mollification. The step bound
  is `abs_integral_gaussian_smoothed_swap_le` for `j ≥ 1` and, for **every** `j` (in particular
  `j = 0`, where the smoothing has width `0`), `abs_integral_swap_step_le` applied after
  `integral_integral_swap` moves the smoothing variable outside. Brick (iii) sums the minimum of
  the two, giving `(J (M/6) n^{-3/2} + 3C/√J)(β_ν + β_G)` for every cut `J ≥ 2`. The endpoints
  are `measure_pi_dirac_zero` (`⨂ δ₀ = δ₀`, by `Measure.pi_eq`) for `I n` and `√0 = 0` for `I 0`.

  In the assembly the cut is `J = max 2 ⌈ε² n⌉`, which gives `J (M/6) n^{-3/2} ≤ C₃/(2ε√n)` and
  `3C/√J ≤ 3C/(ε√n)`. The bookkeeping `J ≤ ε² n + 2` is only useful when `ε² n ≥ 1`; in the
  complementary window the asserted bound already exceeds `1` (because `β ≥ k^{3/2} ≥ 1`), so
  that case is discharged from `μₙ(B) ≤ 1` alone.

## Wave-19 amendment: the two ingredients of the induction, and what is still missing

The wave-16 note named the missing induction as a *two-part project* rather than a verdict. Both
parts are now discharged, each as a standalone, `0`-sorry, axiom-clean statement; the
declaration `SmoothTestLargeK.bentkus_berry_esseen_convex` nevertheless stays `sorry`, because
the two parts do not by themselves produce the recursion — see below.

**(1) The weighted Cameron–Martin remainder** (`integral_abs_mul_vecTiltRemainder_le`, with the
localised corollary `abs_integral_mul_vecTiltRemainder_le_of_support`). The existing
`integral_abs_vecTiltRemainder_le` bounds the remainder against `‖G‖_∞ = 1`; the localisation
needs it integrated against `|G|`. Cauchy–Schwarz reduces this to an `L²(γ)` bound on the
remainder, `integral_sq_vecTiltRemainder_le : ∫ R_w² dγ ≤ tiltSqConst ‖w‖⁶` for `‖w‖ ≤ 1`,
proved by the same exponential envelope as the `L¹` bound (whose square is again Gaussian
integrable, `sq_tiltEnvSmall_le`) and by the same one-dimensional-marginal reduction — so the
constant is again **dimension-free** and the power of `‖w‖` is still `3`. The upshot is that a
test function supported on the `ε`-shell of `∂B` costs `√(γ(shell))` instead of `1`.
(`‖w‖ ≤ 1` is not a defect: the `L²` statement is *false* for large tilts, where
`∫ exp(2st − s²) dγ = exp(s²)`; the telescope only ever uses `‖w‖ = c/σⱼ ≤ 1`.)

**(2) The self-improving recursion**, solved in the `SelfImproving` section at the end of the
file. Three shapes, all proved:

* `Δ ≤ A δ ε⁻³ (C ε + 2Δ) + C ε` (the wave-16 note verbatim) ⟹ `Δ³ ≤ 63 C³ A δ`;
* `Δ ≤ A δ ε⁻¹ (C ε + 2Δ) + C ε` (after the Gaussian smoothing that this file already proves,
  which is what turns `ε⁻³` into `ε⁻¹`) ⟹ `Δ ≤ 10 A C δ`, i.e. **exactly the sharp `β/√n`
  rate**, with the dimension only in `C = C_k`;
* `Δ ≤ A δ ε⁻¹ √(C ε + 2Δ) + C ε` — the shape the `L²` weighting of (1) actually delivers —
  ⟹ `Δ³ ≤ 216 (C A δ)²`, i.e. `O(n^{-1/3})`.

## Wave-20 amendment: the recursion is produced; the residue is two named bricks

Wave 19 left the *production* of `hrec` open, with two structural obstacles. Both are now
resolved, and the recursion is assembled: `berryEsseen_convex_sharp` states the sharp rate

`|μₙ(B) − γ(B)| ≤ 72 A C_k · β/√n` for measurable convex `B`,

**linear in `δ = β/√n`**, proved from `exists_convexDiscrepancy_recursion` fed to
`le_of_selfImproving_induction`. It is not axiom-clean: it inherited exactly two named,
precisely stated bricks, `hybridLaw_shell_le` and `exists_localised_swap_bound` (the first is
proved in wave 22, below; the second's weight hypothesis is amended in wave 29). Everything
between the bricks and the headline is proved.

*Obstacle 1 (the class) is overturned rather than solved.* The `ε`-shell of a convex set is
`Bᵋ \ interior B`, a difference of two convex sets — but the induction does **not** have to be
enlarged to that class. `measureReal_diff_le_of_convexDiscrepancy` observes that
`μ(B₁ \ B₂) = μ(B₁) − μ(B₂)` for `B₂ ⊆ B₁`, so two applications of the *convex* bound suffice;
the difference structure survives only as the factor `2` in `C ε + 2Δ`. The class the induction
runs on is `convexDiscrepancy`, the supremum over measurable convex sets, and it is closed under
everything the argument does to it — including affine maps
(`measureReal_shell_preimage_aff_le`).

*Obstacle 2 (the family) is solved by the range `n/2 ≤ m ≤ n`.* `hybridLaw n j ν` makes the
telescope's hybrid `n^{-1/2} ∑_{i ≥ j} Yᵢ + (j/n)^{1/2} Z` an explicit measure. For `2j ≥ n` its
own Gaussian component has width `≥ 1/√2` and bounds the shell mass outright, with no induction
(`gaussian_measureReal_shell_preimage_aff_le`, proved). For `2j ≤ n` the non-Gaussian part is a
normalised sum of `m = n − j ≥ n/2` summands, so only the discrepancies at sizes
`n/2 ≤ m ≤ n` are needed — including `m = n` itself, since the `j = 0` hybrid *is* `μₙ`. That is
exactly the neighbour range of `le_of_selfImproving_induction`, which closes at `K = 18 A C`
with no base case.

## Wave-22 amendment: brick H is proved, and the shell constant drops from `k^{3/2}` to `√k`

**Brick H is discharged.** `hybridLaw_shell_le` is now a theorem, axiom-clean. The debt wave 20
identified — the Fubini factorisation of `hybridLaw` — is supplied by applying `Measure.prod`'s
two Fubini identities to the explicit hybrid map: `Measure.prod_apply` in the Gaussian-dominant
regime `2j ≥ n`, `Measure.prod_apply_symm` in the sum-dominant regime `2j ≤ n`, in each case
landing on the wave-20 affine transport `measureReal_shell_preimage_aff_le`. The only genuinely
new ingredient is `map_sum_pi_dirac_drop`: the `δ₀` factors of the hybrid product measure drop
out of the law of the coordinate sum, so the sum-dominant regime really does see `sumLaw (n−j) ν`
(proved by characteristic functions — `charFun_map_sum_pi` — with no index surgery). The moment
hypotheses turn out to be unnecessary for brick H: it is purely geometric.

**The one remaining brick.** `exists_localised_swap_bound` —
`abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_improved` rerun with a shell-weighted Cameron–Martin remainder
in place of the uniform one, so that each step of the telescope is weighted by the *hybrid's*
shell mass. Note that it asks for the `L^∞` weight `W`, which is strictly stronger than the
wave-19 `L²` lemma `abs_integral_mul_vecTiltRemainder_le_of_support` (that one gives `√W`, hence
only `O(n^{-1/3})`), and is not a corollary of it: the weight must be carried by the hybrid law,
not by `γ`. The best *proved* convex bound remains `berryEsseen_convex_improved` at
`(β/√n)^{1/2}`.

## Wave-24 amendment: brick L as frozen is FALSE; the amended brick, and its provable half

**The wave-20 statement of brick L is false.** It asserted
`|∫f dμₙ − ∫f dγ| ≤ A (β/√n) ε⁻¹ W` for the *bare* weight `W`, and the bare weight can sit far
below the Gaussian shell scale `C_k ε` while the two laws are still far apart. The witness, in
full at `exists_localised_swap_bound`, is `k = 1`, `n = 1`, `ε = 1` and a two-point law with an
atom of mass `p` at `−a`, `a = √((1−p)/p)`, against the half-line `B = (−∞, −a/2]`: the shell
misses both atoms, so `W` may be taken exponentially small in `1/p`, while the left-hand side is
`≍ p`.

**The amendment** replaces the weight by `W + C_k ε`, `C_k = gaussianShellConst k`. It is free at
the only call site — `exists_convexDiscrepancy_recursion` feeds `W = 4 C_k ε + 2 Y` with `Y ≥ 0`,
and `W + C_k ε ≤ (5/4) W` there — so the recursion, `berryEsseen_convex_sharp` and its constant
shape are unchanged apart from a factor `2` absorbed into `A`.

**Half of the amended brick is now proved.** `exists_smooth_swap_bound_of_one_le_weight` closes
it whenever the total weight is `≥ 1`, with no localisation whatsoever: for `ε√n ≥ 1` it is the
unweighted `abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_balanced`, and for `ε√n < 1` it is `|∫f dμ − ∫f dγ|
≤ 2` together with `(β/√n) ε⁻¹ ≥ β ≥ k^{3/2} ≥ 1`. What is left is the named brick
`localised_swap_bound_small_weight`, the same statement under `W + C_k ε ≤ 1`.

**What that residue actually needs** (this corrects the wave-22 reading, which called the
localisation a mechanical substitution of the wave-19 lemma). Along the Cameron–Martin route the
test function enters as `G(z) = f(v + σⱼ z)` — the function, not its third derivative, which has
been moved onto the Gaussian density — and `G` is *not* supported on the shell, since `f = 1` on
`B`. Splitting `f = 1_{interior B} + g` leaves the indicator part
`∫ 1_K(z) R_w(z) dγ(z) = γ(K − w) − Q_w(K)` with `K` convex. Wave 24 concluded that controlling
that by the shell mass is a Gaussian surface-area statement about convex bodies (Ball's input);
**wave 29 overturns this** — see the next section.

## Wave-29 amendment: no surface area is needed; the two-sided shell; the residue re-scoped

**The wave-24 obstruction is not real.** The tilt remainder has *mean zero*,
`integral_vecTiltRemainder_eq_zero`, so a constant may be subtracted from the test function for
free (`abs_integral_mul_vecTiltRemainder_le_of_const_off`, the wave-19 lemma extended from
"vanishes off `S`" to "is constant off `S`"). A mollified convex indicator is constant on the
ball of radius `r` about any `v` at distance `≥ r` from the shell, so the indicator part is
localised by the plain **Gaussian tail** `γ{‖z‖ ≥ r/σ}`
(`abs_integral_shift_vecTiltRemainder_le_of_const_ball`), which `stdGaussian_norm_ge_le` supplies
by Markov at any order. All of these are proved, axiom-clean, and dimension-free; no surface
measure occurs anywhere.

**The shell must be two-sided, and controlled at every width.** The set of points where the
localisation fails is `Bˢ \ B_{−s}` — the *two-sided* shell — and the width `s` that step `j` of
the telescope must afford is a multiple of the step width `σⱼ = √(j/n)`, which for `j` near `n`
is `≫ ε`. `gaussian_measureReal_wideShell_le`, `measureReal_wideShell_le_of_convexDiscrepancy`
and their affine transports repeat the outer-shell chain for the two-sided shell (cost: a factor
`2`), and `hybridLaw_wideShell_le` is brick H for it, at every width, uniformly in `j`. The
conditioning that both bricks H share is factored out as `hybridLaw_le_of_affine_le`.

**Consequently the weight hypothesis of brick L is amended** (hypothesis only, conclusion
untouched, and free at the only call site): see `localised_swap_bound_small_weight`.

**Two gaps the wave-24/29 plans did not see**, both recorded in full there: the `L²` tilt bound
needs `‖w‖ = ‖y‖/√j ≤ 1`, so the wave-19 lemma does *not* apply verbatim to the shell part
either, and the large-`‖y‖` region has to be handled by the tilt identity directly (its
`v`-average costs a two-sided shell at width `c‖y‖` — which is why the amended hypothesis is
stated at all widths); and the summed weight is `δ(2 C_k log(1/ε) + W/ε)`, so this route yields
the sharp rate **up to one logarithm**, `C_k (β/√n)(1 + log(√n/β))`. The logarithm is intrinsic
to a single mollification width.

**Constant deviation** (provable-constants rule): this route now gives `C ∼ k^{1/2}`, through
`gaussianShellConst k = 4 e² √k`, not Bentkus's `400 k^{1/4}`. Wave 22 removed the factor `k`
that the `2k`-fold coordinate cover used to contribute to the shell bound — a single random
Gaussian shift replaces it (`gaussian_le_of_gaussian_shift_cover`) — and the residual `√k` is
the first absolute moment `E‖Z‖ ≤ √k` of that shift. Closing the last gap to `k^{1/4}` needs
Ball's Gaussian-surface-area theorem; nothing in the recursion depends on it.

/-! ### Dimension-free ball anti-concentration (the radial analogue)

For the *ball* route the relevant anti-concentration statement is the mass of a thin spherical
**shell** `{t < ‖z‖ ≤ t + ε}` under `N(0, I_k)`. Its clean reduction is that the law of `‖z‖²`
under `N(0, I_k)` is exactly the chi-squared law `χ²_k`, so the shell mass is a chi-squared
interval mass. The genuinely dimension-free fact is that the **chi density** `f_k(r) = c_k r^{k-1}
e^{-r²/2}` (equivalently `2√x · gammaPDF (k/2) (1/2) x`) has a maximum bounded by an *absolute*
constant, uniformly in `k` — its peak `≈ e^{1/2}/√π < 1` sits at `r = √(k-1)` and does not grow
with `k`. That single uniform bound (`chiSquared_density_mul_sqrt_le`) is the crux; everything else
is the measure-theoretic reduction and an elementary `∫ 1/(2√x) dx = √x` computation.

Both are now proved: the peak bound is obtained **without any Stirling asymptotics** for `Γ` by
restricting Euler's integral to the length-`√p` window `(p, p+√p]` at the peak
(`le_Gamma_add_half`), which is enough because the window's own width supplies exactly the
`√p/√(3p) = 1/√3` that the `x^{-1/2}` factor costs. The resulting absolute constant is
`e√6 < 7`. -/

This replaces the `Γ`-Stirling estimate that Mathlib v4.29.1 does not provide for
half-integer arguments: instead of asymptotics one simply restricts Euler's integral
`Γ(p+1/2) = ∫_{x>0} e^{-x} x^{p-1/2} dx` to the window `(p, p + √p]` of length `√p` sitting at
the peak. On that window `e^{-x} x^p ≥ p^p e^{-p} e^{-1}` (from `log t ≥ 1 - 1/t`, since
`(x-p)² ≤ p < x` there) and `x^{-1/2} ≥ (3p)^{-1/2}` (since `x ≤ p + √p ≤ 3p` for `p ≥ 1/4`);
multiplying by the window length `√p` gives `√p/√(3p) = 1/√3`. -/

/-- **The dimension-free chi-density peak bound.**
`2√x · gammaPDF (k/2) (1/2) x ≤ 7` for all `k > 0` and `x > 0`. The left side is exactly the chi
density `f_k(√x) = √x^{k-1} e^{-x/2} / (2^{k/2-1} Γ(k/2))`; its maximum over `x` is attained at
`x = k-1` with value `→ e^{1/2}/√π < 1` as `k → ∞`, and the proof below shows it never exceeds
`e√6 < 7`. **This is the one genuinely dimension-free crux of the ball route.**

Proof. Write `a = k/2` and `p = a - 1/2`. Then
`2√x · gammaPDFReal a (1/2) x = 2 (1/2)^a Γ(a)⁻¹ · x^p e^{-x/2}`; the kernel factor is maximised
at `x = 2p` (`rpow_mul_exp_neg_half_le`), and `(1/2)^a (2p)^p = (√2)⁻¹ p^p`, so the whole
expression is at most `√2 · p^p e^{-p} / Γ(p + 1/2)`, which `le_Gamma_add_half` bounds by
`√2 · e √3 = e √6 < 7` — with **no dependence on `k`**. The degenerate case `k = 1` (`p = 0`) is
separate and uses `Γ(1/2) = √π`. -/

/-! ### The remaining ingredients of the elementary route

Of the analytic bricks of the Lindeberg-swap route, the third-order Taylor remainder
(`norm_taylor_remainder_three_le`) and — for the **ball** route — the smoothed radial
indicator (`exists_smoothed_radial_indicator`) are now proved here, unconditionally and with
dimension-free constants. The **multivariate Lindeberg swap** `abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_le`
and — for the *convex* route — `exists_smoothed_convex_indicator` are proved here as well, so no
brick of the route is left as debt. The honest final bounds
`berryEsseen_ball_elementary` / `berryEsseen_convex_elementary` record the exact statements the
route delivers; their exponent `(β/√n)^{1/4}` is the genuine — non-sharp — outcome (see the
module docstring). -/

heart of the Lindeberg swap. Mathlib v4.29.1 has only the one-dimensional Taylor remainder, so we
reduce to the segment `t ↦ f (x + t • h)` (a `C³` map `ℝ → ℝ`), apply the 1-D Lagrange bound, and
identify `(d/dt)ᵐ f(x+t•h) = iteratedFDeriv ℝ m f (x+t•h) (fun _ => h)` via the composition of the

/-! #### The smoothed indicator of an arbitrary set (mollification)

This block pays what the wave-4 note called the "`precompR` bookkeeping" debt: it constructs,
for an arbitrary set `B ⊆ ℝ^k` and an arbitrary width `ε > 0`, a `C³` function `f : ℝ^k → [0,1]`
that is `1` on `B`, vanishes outside the `ε`-thickening of `B`, and satisfies
`‖D³f‖ ≤ C₃(k)/ε³` with `C₃(k)` fixed *before* `B` and `ε`.

The construction is the mollification predicted by the note, with one simplification that
removes its most delicate step. Rather than rescaling the `ContDiffBump` kernel with `ε` (which
would require the `δ`-dilation identity for `ContDiffBump` together with the Haar change of
variables `∫ g(δ·) = δ^{-k} ∫ g`), we build the width-`1` object once and obtain the width-`ε`
object by **dilating the set**: applying the width-`1` construction to `ε⁻¹ • B` and
precomposing with the continuous linear map `x ↦ ε⁻¹ • x`. All the `ε`-dependence then comes
from `ContinuousLinearMap.iteratedFDeriv_comp_right` together with
`ContinuousMultilinearMap.norm_compContinuousLinearMap_le`, i.e. from `‖L‖³ ≤ ε⁻³`; no measure
rescaling is needed anywhere.

At width `1` the construction is: mollify the indicator of `Metric.thickening (1/2) B` with the
normed bump of radii `1/8 < 1/4`. The support clause holds because `1/2 + 1/4 < 1`, the value
clause because the whole mass of the kernel sits inside the thickening when `x ∈ B`, and
`0 ≤ f ≤ 1` because the kernel is a probability density.

For the third derivative we use the only differentiation formula Mathlib v4.29.1 has for
convolutions, the first-order `HasCompactSupport.hasFDerivAt_convolution_right`, three times;
the resulting tower `L`, `L.precompR`, `L.precompR.precompR` is glued to `iteratedFDeriv` by
three applications of `norm_iteratedFDeriv_fderiv`, exactly as the wave-4 note predicted. The
`precompR` tower costs nothing quantitatively because `‖L.precompR E‖ ≤ ‖L‖`
(`ContinuousLinearMap.norm_precompR_le`) and `‖lsmul ℝ ℝ‖ ≤ 1`, so the bound is simply
`‖D³f‖ ≤ ∫ ‖D³φ‖` for the fixed kernel `φ`.

Note that **convexity of `B` is never used**: the mollification works for any set. Convexity is
needed only for the *other* convex ingredient, the boundary-shell bound `γ(Bᵋ \ B) ≤ C_k ε`,
which lives in `StatLean.HypothesisTesting.ForMathlib.GaussianShell`
(`gaussian_thickening_le`; see `berryEsseen_convex_elementary` for the assembly). -/

/-- **Smoothed convex indicator with controlled third derivative.**
In each dimension `k` there is a constant `C₃` (quantified *before* `B` and `ε`, so the bound
is not vacuous) such that every convex `B` and width `ε > 0` admit a smooth `f : ℝ^k → [0,1]`
equal to `1` on `B`, supported inside the `ε`-thickening of `B`, with `‖D³f‖ ≤ C₃ / ε³`.

**Proof.** Apply `exists_smoothed_indicator_unit` to the dilate `ε⁻¹ • B` and precompose with
the continuous linear map `L : x ↦ ε⁻¹ • x`. Membership and support transport along `L` because
`dist (ε⁻¹ • x) (ε⁻¹ • w) = ε⁻¹ * dist x w`, and the derivative bound transports by
`ContinuousLinearMap.iteratedFDeriv_comp_right` together with
`ContinuousMultilinearMap.norm_compContinuousLinearMap_le`, which contribute the factor
`‖L‖³ ≤ ε⁻³`. Note `‖L‖ ≤ ε⁻¹` is used as an inequality rather than an equality, so the
degenerate dimension `k = 0` (where `‖id‖ = 0`) is covered too.

Convexity of `B` is not used; it is kept only because the statement is frozen. -/

/-! #### The smoothed radial indicator

The construction composes a **fixed** one-dimensional cutoff with the *squared* norm `‖·‖²`
rather than with `‖·‖`. This is what makes the third-derivative constant genuinely
dimension-free *and* elementary: `‖·‖²` is a quadratic polynomial, so `D¹‖·‖² = 2⟪z,·⟫`,
`D²‖·‖² = 2⟪·,·⟫` and `D³‖·‖² = 0`, with dimension-free norms `2‖z‖`, `2`, `0` — all obtained
from Mathlib's bilinear iterated-derivative bound applied to `innerSL ℝ`. In particular the
quantitative iterated-derivative bounds for `‖·‖` away from the origin (which Mathlib v4.29.1
does not provide, and which the `χ ∘ ‖·‖` route would need) are never used. -/

/-- **Smoothed radial indicator with an absolute (dimension-free) third-derivative constant.**
There is a constant `C₃` — independent of the dimension `k`, the radius `a` and the width `ε` —
such that for every ball `{‖z‖ ≤ a}` with `0 ≤ a` and every width `ε > 0` there is a smooth
`f : ℝ^k → [0,1]`, equal to `1` on `{‖z‖ ≤ a}`, vanishing on `{‖z‖ > a + ε}`, with
`‖D³f‖ ≤ C₃ / ε³`. This is the radial analogue of `exists_smoothed_convex_indicator`, and unlike
the convex one its constant is genuinely dimension-free.

**Construction.** `f = χ(( ‖·‖² − a²)/W)` with `W = (a+ε)² − a² = ε(2a+ε)` and `χ` the *fixed*
cutoff `radialCutoff` (`1` on `(-∞,0]`, `0` on `[1,∞)`). Composing with `‖·‖²` rather than with
`‖·‖` is essential: `‖·‖²` is a quadratic polynomial, hence globally smooth (no singularity at
the origin) with `‖D¹‖·‖²‖ = 2‖z‖`, `‖D²‖·‖²‖ ≤ 2`, `D³‖·‖² = 0`, all dimension-free.

**Third-derivative bound.** Write `u = ‖·‖²/W`, so `f = χ(· − a²/W) ∘ u`. On the transition
shell `a ≤ ‖z‖ ≤ a+ε` one has `‖D¹u‖ = 2‖z‖/W ≤ 2(a+ε)/(ε(2a+ε)) ≤ 2/ε` and
`‖D²u‖ = 2/W ≤ 4/ε² = (2/ε)²`, while `D³u = 0`; so `‖Dⁱu‖ ≤ D^i` with the *single* geometric
ratio `D = 2/ε`, and Mathlib's `norm_iteratedFDeriv_comp_le` gives
`‖D³f‖ ≤ 3! · B · (2/ε)³ = 48B/ε³` with `B` the absolute bound of `exists_radialCutoff_bound`.
Off that shell `f` is locally constant, so `D³f = 0`.

Note the hypothesis `ε ≤ a` of the earlier `χ ∘ ‖·‖` formulation is **not** needed here: the
squared-norm route is uniform down to `a = 0`. -/

/-! #### Gaussian stability of the normalized sum

The right-hand endpoint of the Lindeberg telescope is the Gaussian law itself: replacing all
`n` summands by Gaussians and normalizing by `√n` reproduces `N(0, I_k)` exactly. This is
proved by characteristic functions — the `n`-fold product measure factorizes the integral
(`integral_fintype_prod_eq_prod`) and `charFun_stdGaussian` closes the computation. -/

/-! #### Ingredients of the one-step Lindeberg swap

Second-order Taylor expansion of `u ↦ f (v + c • u)` produces three integrals. The constant
term is trivial; the linear term vanishes because the law is centred (Riesz representative of
`Df(v)` plus `hmean`); and the quadratic term takes the **same value for any two laws with
identity covariance**, so no closed form for it is ever needed — only the fact that the two
values coincide. That last observation is what `integral_bilin_eq_basis_sum` records: it
evaluates `∫ D²f(v)(y,y)` as a fixed finite sum over the standard basis, whose value depends on
the law only through `hcov`. -/

Both integrals are compared with the *same* number `f v + (c²/2) S`, where `S` is the

vanishes on either side by `integral_clm_eq_zero_of_centred`, and the quadratic term has the

/-! #### Peeling one coordinate out of a product measure

The hybrid telescope replaces the summands one at a time, so each step must isolate a single
coordinate of a `Measure.pi` over a family of *unequal* laws. This is
`MeasureTheory.measurePreserving_piFinSuccAbove` (the coordinate `i` splits off as a `prod`
factor) followed by Fubini; the `Fin.insertNth` bookkeeping is `Fin.sum_univ_succAbove`. -/

/-- **Lindeberg smooth-function comparison for the normalized sum.**
For a *fixed* `C³` test function `f` with `‖f‖_∞ ≤ 1` and `‖D³f‖ ≤ M`, replacing the `n` centred,
identity-covariance summands by Gaussians one at a time gives an error `≤ M (β + β_G) / (6√n)`,
where `β = ∫‖y‖³ dν` and `β_G = ∫‖z‖³ dN(0,I_k)`. This is `n^{-1/2}` for fixed `f`; the
degradation to `n^{-1/8}` for *sets* comes only from taking `f` a smoothed indicator with
`M ~ ε^{-3}` and optimising `ε`.

**Amendment (documented).** A boundedness hypothesis `hfb : ∀ x, |f x| ≤ 1` has been added.
The statement is true without it — `‖D³f‖ ≤ M` bounds `|f|` by a cubic polynomial, which is
`ν`-integrable by `hβ` and `Measure.pi`-integrable after a power-mean bound
`‖∑ yᵢ‖³ ≤ n² ∑ ‖yᵢ‖³` — but the resulting integrability bookkeeping is several hundred lines of
pure overhead. The lemma is `private`, and its only consumer,
`berryEsseen_ball_elementary`, applies it to smoothed indicators with values in `[0,1]`, which
supply `hfb` for free. No generality that any caller uses is lost.

The proof is the hybrid telescope over
`Qⱼ := Measure.pi (fun i => if i < j then γ else ν)`, `j = 0, …, n`, with

* `Q₀ = ⨂ⁿ ν`, whose pushforward under `n^{-1/2} ∑` is the left endpoint;
* `Qₙ = ⨂ⁿ γ`, whose pushforward is `γ` itself by `map_normalized_sum_stdGaussian`;
* each step `Qⱼ → Qⱼ₊₁` isolated by `integral_pi_sum_peel` (Fubini after
  `measurePreserving_piFinSuccAbove`) — the two hybrids differ *only* in the `j`-th factor, so
  after peeling that coordinate the outer measure over the remaining `n − 1` coordinates is
  literally the same, and the inner integrals differ by `abs_integral_swap_step_le` uniformly in
  the outer variable.

An earlier note preferred a doubled space `(⨂ν).prod (⨂γ)` with independence arguments, to
avoid "peeling a coordinate out of a product of unequal factors". That was the wrong call:
`measurePreserving_piFinSuccAbove` peels a coordinate out of a `Measure.pi` over an arbitrary
*dependent* family at no extra cost, and the hybrid family needs no independence API at all.

The `n` steps each cost `M/6 · n^{-3/2} (β + β_G)`, and `n · n^{-3/2} = n^{-1/2}`. -/

/-! #### Moment facts consumed by the ball assembly

Two elementary consequences of the standing hypotheses (`hcov`, `hβ`, `ν` a probability
measure) that the `ε`-optimisation needs: the second moment is exactly the dimension, and
`β = ∫‖y‖³ dν` is bounded below by `k^{3/2}` (Lyapunov) — in particular `β > 0`, so that
`ε := (β/√n)^{1/4}` is a legitimate positive smoothing width. -/

/-- **The second moment is the dimension.** Under identity covariance,
`∫ ‖y‖² dν = k`. Expand `‖y‖² = ∑ᵢ ⟪eᵢ, y⟫²` over the standard orthonormal basis and apply
`hcov` coordinatewise; the interchange is legitimate because `hβ` makes each coordinate square
integrable. -/

/-! #### The Gaussian third moment `β_G = ∫‖z‖³ dN(0,I_k)`

The `ε`-optimisation also needs the *Gaussian* side of the third moment to be comparable to
`β`. Since `‖z‖² ∼ χ²_k`, the two public χ² moments (`integral_id_chiSquared` `E X = k`,
`variance_chiSquared` `E (X−k)² = 2k`) suffice, through the pointwise inequality

`r³ ≤ u r² + (r² − u²)²/(2u) + u (r² − u²)/2`, `u = √k`,

which is exactly `r²(u − r)² ≥ 0` after multiplying by `2u`. Integrating gives
`β_G ≤ k^{3/2} + √k ≤ 2 k^{3/2}`, and `k^{3/2} ≤ β` (Lyapunov) then gives `β_G ≤ 2β`. No
Cauchy–Schwarz and no fourth χ² moment are needed. -/

/-- **Elementary ball Berry–Esseen bound, with a dimension-free constant (honest, non-sharp).**
There is an *absolute* constant `C` — independent of the dimension `k`, the sample size `n` and
the sampling law `ν` — such that the normal approximation to the law of `‖n^{-1/2} ∑ᵢ Yᵢ‖²` over
half-lines `{‖z‖² ≤ t}` is accurate to `C · (β/√n)^{1/4}`, where `β = ∫‖y‖³ dν`. This is the
*honest* output of the elementary "smooth the indicator + Lindeberg swap" route for **balls**:
the constant is dimension-free (the ball anti-concentration `gaussian_ball_shell_measure_le` and
the radial smoothing `exists_smoothed_radial_indicator` both have dimension-free constants), but
the rate is `(β/√n)^{1/4} = n^{-1/8}`, **not** Bentkus's `β/√n = n^{-1/2}`. The degradation is
intrinsic to the mollifier method (see the module docstring).

Assembly (the `ε`-optimisation): for the set `{‖z‖ ≤ s}` (`s = √t`) sandwich the indicator between
two smoothed radial indicators of widths `ε` (`exists_smoothed_radial_indicator`); the swap
`abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_le` bounds `|E f(Sₙ) − E f(G)| ≤ (C₃/ε³)(β + β_G)/(6√n)`, and the
Gaussian shell mass of `{s < ‖z‖ ≤ s+ε}` is `≤ C_ac ε` (`gaussian_ball_shell_measure_le`). Adding
and choosing `ε = (β/√n)^{1/4}` balances `ε⁻³ · β/√n` against `ε` at `(β/√n)^{1/4}`.

**State of the assembly.** Two of the three geometric bricks are now *proved unconditionally*
and with dimension-free constants:

* `gaussian_ball_shell_measure_le` (`C_ac = 7`) — no longer conditional on any `Γ`-Stirling
  estimate, see `chiSquared_density_mul_sqrt_le`;
* `exists_smoothed_radial_indicator` (`C₃ = 48 B`) — proved through the squared-norm route, so
  it holds for **every** `0 ≤ a` and `ε > 0`. In particular the small-radius case `√t < ε`,
  which the older `χ ∘ ‖·‖` formulation had to treat separately (its `ε ≤ a` hypothesis is
  gone), no longer needs any special handling.

The moment facts the `ε`-optimisation needs are also proved here:
`integral_normSq_eq_dim` (`∫‖y‖² dν = k`), `sqrt_dim_mul_dim_le_integral_norm_cube` (Lyapunov,
`k^{3/2} ≤ β`) and `integral_norm_cube_pos` (`β > 0`, so `ε := (β/√n)^{1/4}` is a legitimate
positive width).

The Gaussian side of the third moment is now proved too: `integral_norm_cube_gaussian_le`
gives `β_G ≤ 2 k^{3/2} ≤ 2 β` from the two *public* χ² moments (`E X = k`, `E (X−k)² = 2k`)
— no fourth χ² moment and no Cauchy–Schwarz are needed, see its docstring.

**The assembly below is complete and consumes nothing on faith**: its last ingredient,
`abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_le` (the third-order multivariate Lindeberg swap), is proved
above, so `berryEsseen_ball_elementary` is axiom-clean. Concretely, with `ε := (β/√n)^{1/4}`:

* upper: `μₙ{‖z‖ ≤ s} ≤ ∫ f_ε dμₙ ≤ ∫ f_ε dγ + (C₃/ε³)(β+β_G)/(6√n) ≤ γ{‖z‖ ≤ s+ε} + (C₃/2)ε`
  with `f_ε` the smoothed radial indicator at radius `s`, and then
  `γ{‖z‖ ≤ s+ε} ≤ γ{‖z‖ ≤ s} + C_ac ε` by shell anti-concentration;
* lower: the same with the smoothed indicator at radius `s − ε` when `ε ≤ s`; when `s < ε` the
  ball is contained in `{‖z‖ ≤ ε}` and the shell bound at radius `0` closes it directly (the
  Gaussian has no atom at the origin, `gaussian_origin_measure_zero`).

Both `(β/√n)/ε³ = ε` steps are the `ε`-balance, and the resulting absolute constant is
`C = C_ac + C₃/2`. -/

/-! #### The convex headline in Lévy (thickening) form

The convex headline `berryEsseen_convex_elementary` is assembled in two steps. The first — and
the one where the mollification of `exists_smoothed_convex_indicator` is actually consumed — is
the Lévy/Prokhorov-type inequality between `μₙ(B)` and `γ(Bᵋ)` (rather than between `μₙ(B)` and
`γ(B)`), which needs no boundary-shell input at all. That is `berryEsseen_convex_levy_elementary`
below. The second step collapses `γ(Bᵋ)` back to `γ(B)` (and dually `γ(B)` to `γ(B₋ᵋ)`) at cost
`C_k ε`; that is `gaussian_thickening_le` / `gaussian_le_erosion_add` of
`StatLean.HypothesisTesting.ForMathlib.GaussianShell`. Nothing else is needed, and the headline
follows by the same `ε`-balance as `berryEsseen_ball_elementary`. -/

/-- **Elementary convex Berry–Esseen bound, Lévy (thickening) form.** For every dimension `k > 0`
there is a constant `C` such that for every convex measurable `B`, every width `ε > 0` and every
`n > 0`,

`μₙ(B) ≤ γ(Bᵋ) + C (β/√n)/ε³` and `γ(B) ≤ μₙ(Bᵋ) + C (β/√n)/ε³`,

where `μₙ` is the law of the normalized sum, `γ = N(0, I_k)`, `β = ∫‖y‖³ dν` and `Bᵋ` is the
`ε`-thickening of `B`.

Both inequalities are the Lindeberg swap `abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_le` applied to the
smoothed indicator of `exists_smoothed_convex_indicator`, sandwiched between `1_B` and `1_{Bᵋ}`;
`C = C₃/2` where `C₃` is the third-derivative constant of the smoothed indicator (the factor
`3 ≥ (β + β_G)/β` from `integral_norm_cube_gaussian_le` is what turns `C₃/6` into `C₃/2`).

This is the whole analytic content of `berryEsseen_convex_elementary`: taking `ε = (β/√n)^{1/4}`
here gives `μₙ(B) ≤ γ(Bᵋ) + C ε` and `γ(B) ≤ μₙ(Bᵋ) + C ε`, and the only remaining step is to
replace `γ(Bᵋ)` by `γ(B) + C_k ε` (and, applying the second inequality to the erosion of `B`,
`γ(B)` by `γ(B₋ᵋ) + C_k ε`), which is `gaussian_thickening_le` / `gaussian_le_erosion_add` of
`StatLean.HypothesisTesting.ForMathlib.GaussianShell`. -/

/-- **Elementary convex-set Berry–Esseen bound (honest, non-sharp).** For every dimension `k > 0`
there is a constant `C` such that for all `n > 0`, every centred identity-covariance law `ν` with
finite third moment `β = ∫‖y‖³ dν`, and every measurable convex `B`,

`|μₙ(B) − γ(B)| ≤ C (β/√n)^{1/4}`,

where `μₙ` is the law of `n^{-1/2} ∑ᵢ Yᵢ` and `γ = N(0, I_k)`.

Optimising `ε` in `ε^{-3} β/√n + C ε` balances steps 2–3 at `ε = (β/√n)^{1/4}`, giving an error of
order `(β/√n)^{1/4} = n^{-1/8}` — **not** the `n^{-1/2}` rate of the frozen
`bentkus_berry_esseen_convex`. The constant also carries a dimension factor: it is
`C = C₀ + C_k` with `C₀` the third-derivative constant of `exists_smoothed_convex_indicator` and
`C_k = gaussianShellConst k = 4 e² √k` the Gaussian boundary-shell constant.

**This exponent is not the ceiling of the elementary route** (wave-13 correction of an earlier
note that claimed it was): exploiting the Gaussian mollification the hybrid telescope carries for
free, `ε^{-3}` can be replaced by `ε^{-1}`, which balances at `(β/√n)^{1/2} = n^{-1/4}`. As of
wave 16 that improvement is **proved**, as `berryEsseen_convex_improved` at the end of this file
(`0`-sorry, axiom-clean); this theorem is kept as it stands because it has consumers and is a
different, weaker statement. The sharp `400 k^{1/4} · β/√n` needs Bentkus's self-improving
induction and is still not attempted.
(Ball's theorem gives the sharp shell constant `4 k^{1/4}`, which is
exactly the dimension factor of Bentkus's bound; only *finiteness* at fixed `k` is needed here, and
that is what `GaussianShell` proves elementarily.)

**Proof.** `berryEsseen_convex_levy_elementary` at width `ε := (β/√n)^{1/4}` gives, for every
measurable convex `A`, both `μₙ(A) ≤ γ(Aᵋ) + C₀ ε` and `γ(A) ≤ μₙ(Aᵋ) + C₀ ε` (the balance
`(β/√n)/ε³ = ε` is `hbal` below). Applying the first to `A := B` and collapsing the thickening by
`gaussian_thickening_le` bounds `μₙ(B) − γ(B)`. For the reverse deviation one cannot thicken `μₙ`
— it is not Gaussian — so the second inequality is applied instead to the *erosion*
`A := erosion ε B`, which is open and convex (`isOpen_erosion`, `convex_erosion`) and whose
`ε`-thickening sits inside `B` (`thickening_erosion_subset`); `gaussian_le_erosion_add` then
converts `γ(erosion ε B)` back to `γ(B)`. -/

/-! ### Wave-13: the Cameron–Martin (Gaussian-smoothing) route to a better exponent

The material below is the analytic core of a **strict improvement of the exponent** of
`berryEsseen_convex_elementary`, from `(β/√n)^{1/4}` to `(β/√n)^{1/2}`; see the
"wave-13 amendment" in the module docstring for the derivation. Everything here is proved
outright, and as of wave 16 so is the assembly: the improved headline is
`berryEsseen_convex_improved`, at the very end of the file.

The point is that the `j`-th step of the hybrid telescope already carries an independent
`N(0,(j/n) I_k)` summand, so its test function is automatically Gaussian-mollified at scale
`σ_j = √(j/n)`; and for a Gaussian mollification the Lindeberg remainder costs `σ_j^{-3}` rather
than `‖D³f‖_∞`, because the shift can be moved onto the *density* (Cameron–Martin) instead of
onto the test function. -/

/-! ### Wave-19: the same remainder in `L²` (the weighted / Hölder refinement)

`integral_abs_vecTiltRemainder_le` bounds the Cameron–Martin remainder in `L¹(γ)`, which is
exactly what a swap against a test function with `‖G‖_∞ ≤ 1` needs. The *localised* swap — the
one Bentkus's induction consumes — pairs the remainder instead with a `G` supported on the
`ε`-shell of `∂B`, and must pay only for the shell. Cauchy–Schwarz turns that into an `L²`
bound on the remainder, proved here by the same envelope, whose square is still Gaussian
integrable. -/

/-- **The weighted (Hölder / `L²`) form of `integral_abs_vecTiltRemainder_le`** — the first of
the two ingredients the sharp Bentkus rate needs (wave 19).

`integral_abs_vecTiltRemainder_le` bounds `∫ |R_w| dγ ≤ C‖w‖³`, which is what one pairs with a
test function bounded by `‖G‖_∞ = 1`. Here the remainder is paired with `|G|` itself:

`∫ |G| |R_w| dγ ≤ ‖G‖_{L²(γ)} · √tiltSqConst · ‖w‖³`.

Two things survive the refinement: the constant is still **absolute** (no `k`), because
`integral_sq_vecTiltRemainder_le` is again proved through the one-dimensional marginal; and the
power of `‖w‖` is still `3`, so the telescope arithmetic is unchanged. What is bought is that a
`G` supported on the `ε`-shell of `∂B` now costs `√(γ(shell))` rather than `1`. -/

`|∫ G · R_w dγ| ≤ √(γ S) · √tiltSqConst · ‖w‖³`.

/-- **The localised weighted bound, for a test function that is CONSTANT off a small set**
(wave 29). If `|G| ≤ 1` and `G ≡ a` off a measurable set `S`, with `|a| ≤ 1`, then

`|∫ G · R_w dγ| ≤ 2 √(γ S) · √tiltSqConst · ‖w‖³`.

`abs_integral_mul_vecTiltRemainder_le_of_support` is the case `a = 0`. The extension to a
general constant is *not* cosmetic: it is exactly what the indicator half of a mollified convex
indicator needs. Writing the mollified indicator `f = 1_{interior B} + g` with `g` shell-
supported, the wave-19 lemma applies to `g` but not to `1_{interior B}`, whose Cameron–Martin
error is `γ(K − w) − Q_w(K)` for the convex set `K = (interior B − v)/σ`. Wave 24's docstring
concluded that bounding *that* by the shell mass is a Gaussian-surface-area statement, i.e.
Ball's theorem. **That verdict is wrong.** Since `∫ R_w dγ = 0`
(`integral_vecTiltRemainder_eq_zero`), one may subtract from `1_K` the constant it takes near
the centre: if `v` is at distance `≥ r` from `∂B` then `1_K` is constant on the ball of radius
`r/σ`, and Cauchy–Schwarz against the *Gaussian tail* `γ{‖z‖ ≥ r/σ}` — not against any surface
measure — gives the localisation. See
`abs_integral_shift_vecTiltRemainder_le_of_const_ball`. -/

/-- **The localised Cameron–Martin error at a point far from the boundary** (wave 29). If the
bounded test function `F` is *constant* on the ball of radius `r` around `v` — which for a
mollified convex indicator means exactly that `v` is at distance `≥ r` from the `ε`-shell of
`∂B`, the constant being `1` inside and `0` outside — then the `σ`-smoothed Cameron–Martin
remainder at `v` is weighted by the **Gaussian tail** `γ{‖z‖ ≥ r/σ}`:

`|∫ F(v + σ z) R_w(z) dγ(z)| ≤ 2 √(γ{‖z‖ ≥ r/σ}) · √tiltSqConst · ‖w‖³`.

Combined with `stdGaussian_norm_ge_le` at order `p`, the weight is `2 (E‖z‖^p)^{1/2}(σ/r)^{p/2}`.
This is the localisation that wave 24 declared to be Ball's theorem; it is not. -/

/-- **The Gaussian-smoothed Lindeberg swap step.** If the test function is first mollified by a
Gaussian of scale `σ > 0`, then replacing a summand of law `τ` (centred, identity covariance,
finite third moment) by *any* other such law costs at most `C (c/σ)³ β_τ` — with **no third
derivative of the test function**: the three derivatives are absorbed by the Gaussian kernel
through the Cameron–Martin formula. This is the ingredient that replaces the factor `ε⁻³` of
the mollifier route by `σ⁻³`, and hence improves the exponent of the elementary
Berry–Esseen rate. -/

/-! #### Brick (i): the hybrid telescope that carries its own Gaussian smoothing

The three bricks above are assembled here. The telescoped functional is

`Iⱼ = ∫ x, (∫ z, f (n^{-1/2} (∑ₗ xₗ) + √(j/n) z) dγ(z)) d(⨂ᵢ κ'ⱼ(i))`,
`κ'ⱼ(i) = if i < j then δ₀ else ν`,

so that `I₀` is the law of the normalized sum (the `j = 0` smoothing has width `√0 = 0`) and
`I_n` is the standard Gaussian (all coordinates are Dirac at the origin, and the smoothing has
width `1`). One step replaces the `j`-th coordinate's `ν` by `δ₀` *and* widens the smoothing from
`√(j/n)` to `√((j+1)/n)` — and by `integral_gaussian_pair_smul_add` (brick (ii)) that is exactly
the statement that the fresh `n^{-1/2}`-scaled Gaussian is absorbed into the smoothing. Hence
each step is the comparison of `ν` with `N(0,I_k)` *inside a Gaussian-smoothed test function*,
and admits **two** bounds:

* the elementary one, `abs_integral_swap_step_le` after a Fubini swap that puts the smoothing
  variable outside — cost `(M/6) n^{-3/2}(β_ν + β_G)`, valid at every step including `j = 0`;
* the Cameron–Martin one, `abs_integral_gaussian_smoothed_swap_le` — cost
  `C (n^{-1/2}/√(j/n))³ (β_ν + β_G) = C (β_ν+β_G) j^{-3/2}`, valid for `j ≥ 1`.

`sum_le_of_bounded_and_decay_const` (brick (iii)) sums the minimum of the two. -/

/-! #### The improved convex headline `(β/√n)^{1/2}`

With brick (i) in hand the assembly is the same `ε`-balance as for
`berryEsseen_convex_elementary`, except that the mollifier cost is now `ε^{-1}` rather than
`ε^{-3}`, so the balance `ε^{-1} β/√n + C_k ε` is minimised at `ε = (β/√n)^{1/2}` instead of
`(β/√n)^{1/4}`. The cut in the telescope is `J = max 2 ⌈ε² n⌉`, for which
`J (M/6) n^{-3/2} ≤ C₃/(2 ε √n)` and `3C/√J ≤ 3C/(ε √n)`.

Two side remarks on the bookkeeping. First, `J ≤ ε² n + 2` only helps when `ε² n ≥ 1`; when
`ε² n < 1` the claimed bound already exceeds `1` (because `β ≥ k^{3/2} ≥ 1`), so the inequality
is trivial and is discharged separately. Second, the elementary bounds
`berryEsseen_convex_elementary` and `berryEsseen_ball_elementary` are left untouched: they are
proved and are consumed elsewhere, and the improved bound is a *different* (stronger) statement
rather than a restatement. -/

section ImprovedAssembly

/-- **The improved telescope with the cut already chosen.** For a mollified test function with
`‖D³f‖ ≤ C₃/ε³`, and in the window `ε √n ≥ 1`, choosing the cut `J = max 2 ⌈ε² n⌉` in
`abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_improved` gives

`|∫ f dμₙ − ∫ f dγ| ≤ (3C₃/2 + 9C) (β/√n)/ε`,

the mollifier entering through `ε^{-1}` rather than `ε^{-3}`. The arithmetic is
`J (C₃/6) ε^{-3} n^{-3/2} ≤ C₃/(2ε√n)` (using `J ≤ ε²n + 2 ≤ 3ε²n`) and
`3C/√J ≤ 3C/(ε√n)`, followed by `β + β_G ≤ 3β`. -/

/-- **Improved convex-set Berry–Esseen bound.** For every dimension `k > 0` there is a constant
`C` such that for all `n > 0`, every centred identity-covariance law `ν` with finite third
moment `β = ∫‖y‖³ dν`, and every measurable convex `B`,

`|μₙ(B) − γ(B)| ≤ C (β/√n)^{1/2} = O(n^{-1/4})`.

This is a strict improvement on the exponent `1/4` of `berryEsseen_convex_elementary`
(`n^{-1/8}`), and it is the ceiling of the *non-inductive* elementary route: see the wave-13
amendment in the module docstring. The residual gap to Bentkus's `400 k^{1/4} β/√n` is a further
factor `(β/√n)^{1/2}`, obtainable only by the self-improving induction
`Δ ≤ A ε^{-3} δ (C_k ε + 2Δ) + C_k ε`, which is not attempted here.

The constant is `C = C₀ + C_k` with `C₀` from `berryEsseen_convex_levy_improved` and
`C_k = gaussianShellConst k = 4 e² √k`; the balance is `ε = (β/√n)^{1/2}`, at which
`(β/√n)/ε = ε`. The proof is the same two-sided thickening/erosion argument as
`berryEsseen_convex_elementary`. -/

/-- **Improved ball Berry–Esseen bound, with a dimension-free constant.** There is an
*absolute* constant `C` — independent of the dimension `k`, the sample size `n` and the sampling
law `ν` — with

`|μₙ{‖z‖² ≤ t} − γ{‖z‖² ≤ t}| ≤ C (β/√n)^{1/2} = O(n^{-1/4})`

uniformly in the threshold `t`. This is `berryEsseen_ball_elementary` at the better exponent:
the two share the `ε`-generic assembly `berryEsseen_ball_of_swap`, and differ only in which swap
estimate is fed to it — `abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_le` (cost `C₃/2 · ε`, balanced at
`ε = (β/√n)^{1/4}`) versus `abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_balanced` (cost
`(3C₃/2 + 9C) · ε`, balanced at `ε = (β/√n)^{1/2}`).

The window hypothesis `ε √n ≥ 1` of the balanced swap is automatic at this `ε`: it says
`ε² n = (β/√n) n = β √n ≥ 1`, and `β ≥ k^{3/2} ≥ 1`, `n ≥ 1`.

All three constants are dimension-free (`Cac` from `gaussian_ball_shell_measure_le`, `C₃` from
`exists_smoothed_radial_indicator`, `C` from `exists_tiltRemainder_bound`), so the improved
constant `Cac + 3C₃/2 + 9C` is too. `berryEsseen_ball_elementary` is kept as it stands: it is
what `SmoothTestLargeK.bentkus_berry_esseen_ball` is wired to, and nothing there needs the better
exponent. -/

/-! ### Wave-19: the fixed points of Bentkus's self-improving recursion

The wave-16 note isolated *two* missing ingredients for the sharp rate. The first is the
weighted Cameron–Martin bound `integral_abs_mul_vecTiltRemainder_le` proved above. The second is
the **self-improving induction over `n`**: the localised swap bounds the discrepancy at sample
size `n` by an expression in which the discrepancy *itself* reappears, through the
anti-concentration of the hybrid laws.

Write `Δ` for the supremum, over measurable convex `B`, of `|μₙ(B) − γ(B)|`, and `δ = β/√n`.
The localised telescope replaces the uniform step bound by one weighted by
`P(hybrid ∈ ε-shell of ∂B)`, and that shell probability is at most
`γ(shell) + 2Δ ≤ C_k ε + 2Δ` — Gaussian shell mass (`gaussian_thickening_le`) plus twice the
discrepancy being bounded. The recursions that result are the following three; this section
solves all three as statements about real numbers, so that the only thing left for the
probabilistic side is to *produce* the hypothesis `hrec`.

* `le_of_selfImproving_cube` / `cube_le_of_selfImproving_cube`: the recursion of the wave-16
  note verbatim, `Δ ≤ A δ ε⁻³ (C ε + 2Δ) + C ε` for every `ε > 0`, closes at
  `Δ ≤ (5/2) C e` with `e³ = 4Aδ`, i.e. `Δ³ ≤ 63 C³ A δ`, i.e. `Δ ≲ C δ^{1/3}`.
* `le_of_selfImproving_smoothed`: the same recursion **after** the Gaussian smoothing of the
  hybrid telescope, which turns `ε⁻³` into `ε⁻¹` (this is the wave-13/16 improvement,
  `abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_improved`). It closes at `Δ ≤ 10 A C δ` — **linear in
  `δ = β/√n`, i.e. exactly the sharp Bentkus rate**, with the dimension entering only through
  the shell constant `C = C_k`. This is the precise sense in which "the induction, iterated
  with the Gaussian smoothing, gives the sharp rate".
* `le_of_selfImproving_smoothed_sqrt` / `cube_le_of_selfImproving_smoothed_sqrt`: the variant
  actually supplied by the `L²` weighting proved above, `Δ ≤ A δ ε⁻¹ √(C ε + 2Δ) + C ε`, whose
  fixed point is `Δ ≤ 6 m²` with `m³ = C A δ`, i.e. `Δ³ ≤ 216 (C A δ)²`, i.e.
  `Δ ≲ (C β/√n)^{2/3} = O(n^{-1/3})`.

**Honest status of the probabilistic step.** What is *not* proved here is the production of
`hrec`: it needs the localised telescope, i.e. a rerun of
`abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_improved`
in which each step is estimated by `abs_integral_mul_vecTiltRemainder_le_of_support` with
`G = D³` of the mollified indicator (supported on the `ε`-shell) instead of by the uniform
`abs_integral_gaussian_smoothed_swap_le`, and in which the shell probability *for the hybrid law*
is controlled by the induction hypothesis at the smaller sample sizes. Two concrete obstacles
remain, both structural rather than arithmetic:

1. the shell of `∂B` must be a *set* to which the induction hypothesis applies — one needs
   `γ`-shell mass of a convex set to be estimated by the discrepancy over convex sets, and the
   shell `Bᵋ \ B₋ᵋ` is a difference of two convex sets, so the induction must be run on the
   class of such differences (Bentkus does this; it costs a factor `2` in the constant, which is
   why `2Δ` appears in the recursion above);
2. the induction is over `n`, and the hybrid at step `j` is a law of *`j` Gaussian plus `n − j`
   `ν`* summands, not a rescaled sum of `j` summands, so the inductive hypothesis has to be
   stated for the whole hybrid family rather than for `μₙ` alone.

Neither is attempted here. What the section does deliver is that once `hrec` is available in any
of the three shapes, the rate follows by pure arithmetic — including, in the smoothed case, the
sharp `β/√n`. -/

/-! ### Wave-20: the recursion run as an induction over the hybrid family

The wave-19 fixed points solve the recursion at a *single* scale: they take the inequality
`Δ ≤ A δ ε⁻¹ (C ε + 2Δ) + C ε` as given, with the *same* `Δ` on both sides. That is not the shape
the telescope produces. The `2Δ` on the right is the shell mass of a **hybrid** law
`c ∑_{i ≥ j} Yᵢ + sⱼ Z`, whose non-Gaussian part is a normalised sum of `m = n − j` summands, so
what the right-hand side really sees is the discrepancy `Δ_m` at the *smaller* sample sizes. The
present section supplies the two missing pieces of bookkeeping.

* `le_of_selfImproving_induction` — the recursion as a **strong induction over `n`**. The
  hypothesis is allowed to invoke an arbitrary bound `Y` on `Δ_m` for the neighbours
  `n/2 ≤ m ≤ n` only; this is the range that the telescope actually needs, because for
  `j ≤ n/2` one has `m = n − j ≥ n/2`, while for `j ≥ n/2` the hybrid carries a Gaussian
  component of width `sⱼ ≥ 1/√2` and its shell mass is bounded outright by the Gaussian
  anti-concentration estimate `gaussian_thickening_le`, with no induction at all. Since
  `√m ≥ √n/2` on that range, the inductive bound `K β/√m` self-propagates with `Y = 2 K δ`,
  and the cut `ε = 8 A δ` closes the loop at `K = 18 A C` — the **sharp `β/√n` rate**, with no
  base case needed (for `n = 1` the neighbour range is empty).

* `convexDiscrepancy` and `measureReal_shell_le_of_convexDiscrepancy` — the class the induction
  runs on, and the *derivation* of the shape `C ε + 2Δ`. The `ε`-shell of a convex `B` is
  `Bᵋ \ interior B`, a **difference of two convex sets**; that is why the factor is `2Δ` and not
  `Δ`. But — and this corrects the wave-19 reading of the obstacle — the induction does **not**
  have to be enlarged to the class of differences of convex sets: a difference `B₁ \ B₂` with
  `B₂ ⊆ B₁` has `μ(B₁ \ B₂) = μ(B₁) − μ(B₂)`, so two applications of the *convex* bound suffice
  (`measureReal_diff_le_of_convexDiscrepancy`). The class of measurable convex sets is closed
  under the operations the induction performs.
-/

section SelfImprovingInduction

/-- **The self-improving recursion, run as a strong induction over the sample size.**

If `D : ℕ → ℝ` satisfies, for every `n ≥ 1`, every cut `ε > 0` and every bound `Y` valid on the
neighbour range `n/2 ≤ m < n`,

`D n ≤ A (b/√n) ε⁻¹ (C ε + 2 Y) + C ε`,

then `D n ≤ 18 A C (b/√n)` for all `n ≥ 1`.

This is the shape the localised hybrid telescope produces (see the section docstring): the `2Y`
is the shell mass of the hybrid laws, whose non-Gaussian part is a normalised sum of
`m = n − j ≥ n/2` summands. The proof is a strong induction with `Y = 2 K δ` (legitimate because
`√m ≥ √n/2` on the neighbour range) and the cut `ε = 8 A δ`, at which the recursion reads

/-! #### Wave-29: the *two-sided* shell, and its affine transport

The localised swap step needs more than the outer shell `Bᵋ \ interior B`. A point `v` is
harmless for the localisation exactly when the mollified indicator is **constant** on a ball
around `v` (`abs_integral_shift_vecTiltRemainder_le_of_const_ball`), i.e. when `v` lies either
outside the thickening or inside the *erosion*. The complement of that is the **two-sided**
shell `Bᵋ \ B_{-ε}`, and the inner half `B \ B_{-ε}` is invisible to
`measureReal_shell_le_of_convexDiscrepancy`. The bounds below repeat the outer-shell chain for
the two-sided shell; the cost is a factor `2`, since `gaussian_thickening_le` and
`gaussian_le_erosion_add` each contribute `C_k ε`. -/

`S`, the hybrid mass `hybridLaw n j ν S` is bounded by any `c ≥ 0` that dominates the mass of

Gaussian-dominant regime `n ≤ 2j` and under `sumLaw (n-j) ν` in the sum-dominant regime.

/-- **Brick H (wave 22: PROVED).** *The shell mass of every hybrid law is `≤ 2 C_k ε + 2Y`,
uniformly in `j`.*

This is where the induction is consumed, and the reason the neighbour range of
`le_of_selfImproving_induction` is `n/2 ≤ m ≤ n`. The two regimes:

* **`2j ≥ n` (Gaussian-dominant).** The hybrid is `ρ ∗ γ_σ` with `σ = √j/√n ≥ 1/√2`. Fubini in
  the *sum* coordinate (`Measure.prod_apply`) writes the shell mass as
  `∫ γ((σ · + x)⁻¹ S) dρ(x)`, and for `S = Bᵋ \ interior B` each inner set is the `(ε/σ)`-shell
  of a convex set; `gaussian_measureReal_shell_preimage_aff_le` bounds it by
  `C_k ε/σ ≤ 2 C_k ε`. **No induction is needed in this regime** — the hybrid's own Gaussian
  component does the work.
* **`2j ≤ n` (sum-dominant).** The non-Gaussian part is a normalised sum of `m = n − j ≥ n/2`
  summands, scaled by `λ = √(m/n) ≥ 1/√2` (`map_partial_sum_eq_smul_sumLaw`). Fubini in the
  *Gaussian* coordinate (`Measure.prod_apply_symm`) writes the shell mass as
  `∫ μ_m((λ · + σz)⁻¹ S) dγ(z)`, the `(ε/λ)`-shell of a convex set; the class of measurable
  convex sets is affine-invariant, so `measureReal_shell_preimage_aff_le` applies and gives
  `C_k ε/λ + 2 Δ_m ≤ 2 C_k ε + 2 Y`.

Both regimes use the affine transport proved just above (`measureReal_shell_preimage_aff_le`,
via `preimage_aff_thickening` and `preimage_aff_interior`): the preimage of an `ε`-shell of a
convex set under `x ↦ r x + a` is the `(ε/r)`-shell of a convex set, so the class the induction
runs on is affine-invariant. The convolution bookkeeping that wave 20 left open is supplied by
the two Fubini identities above together with `map_partial_sum_eq_smul_sumLaw`, whose only
non-formal ingredient is `map_sum_pi_dirac_drop` — the `δ₀` factors of the hybrid product drop
out of the law of the coordinate sum.

Wave 29 factored the two-regime conditioning out as `hybridLaw_le_of_affine_le`, which knows
nothing about the shell; what is left here is the two affine-transport estimates. The statement
is unchanged.

The moment hypotheses `hmean`, `hcov`, `hβ` are **not used**: the shell bound is purely
geometric, and only enters the recursion through `convexDiscrepancy`, where the moments are
already assumed. They are retained so that the statement matches the shape the recursion
consumes. -/

`Bᵋ \ B_{-ε}` is `≤ 4 C_k ε + 2Y`, uniformly in `j`.*

The same instance of `hybridLaw_le_of_affine_le` as `hybridLaw_shell_le`, with the two-sided
affine transports (`gaussian_measureReal_wideShell_preimage_aff_le`,
`measureReal_wideShell_preimage_aff_le`) in place of the outer-shell ones; the constant doubles
because the two-sided shell costs `C_k ε` on each side.

This is the form the *localised* swap step needs. The localisation weight at a point `v` is
controlled exactly when the mollified indicator is constant on a ball about `v`
(`abs_integral_shift_vecTiltRemainder_le_of_const_ball`), which fails precisely on the two-sided
shell; the outer shell `Bᵋ \ interior B` of `hybridLaw_shell_le` is blind to the inner half.
Note that `ε` here is arbitrary: in the telescope it is the *step* width `σⱼ = √(j/n)`, not the
mollifier width, and `σⱼ ≫ ε` for `j` large. -/

/-- **Brick L above the Gaussian shell scale (wave 24: PROVED, and no localisation needed).**
As soon as the weight is at least `1`, the *unweighted* balanced telescope already gives the
localised bound, with no reference to `B` at all: for `ε √n ≥ 1` it is
`abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_balanced` together with `W ≥ 1`, and for `ε √n < 1` it is the
trivial bound `|∫ f dμ − ∫ f dγ| ≤ 2` together with
`(β/√n) ε⁻¹ = β/(ε√n) ≥ β ≥ k^{3/2} ≥ 1`.

This is exactly the regime in which brick L has no content; see `exists_localised_swap_bound`,

/-- **Brick L below the Gaussian shell scale (stated, not proved; hypothesis AMENDED in
wave 29).** *The hybrid telescope with every step estimated by the localised weighted swap
bound*, in the only regime that has any content: the total weight `W + C_k ε` is at most `1`.

This is `abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_improved` rerun with a shell-weighted Cameron–Martin
remainder in place of the uniform `integral_abs_vecTiltRemainder_le`. Summing the weighted steps
with the cut `J = ⌈ε² n⌉` of `abs_integral_smooth_sub_gaussian_balanced` gives `A (β/√n) ε⁻¹ W`
in place of the unweighted `A (β/√n) ε⁻¹`.

The `L^∞` form is stated (weight `W`, not `√W`), which is what the sharp `β/√n` rate needs; the
wave-19 `L²`/Cauchy–Schwarz form `abs_integral_mul_vecTiltRemainder_le_of_support` delivers `√W`
instead, for which `cube_le_of_selfImproving_smoothed_sqrt` gives `O(n^{-1/3})`.

## Wave 29: the wave-24 diagnosis is WRONG, and the hypothesis is amended

Wave 24 wrote: splitting `f = 1_{interior B} + g` localises the `g` half by the wave-19 lemma,
but leaves the indicator half `∫ 1_K R_w dγ = γ(K − w) − Q_w(K)`, and "bounding *that* by the
shell mass is a Gaussian surface-area statement about convex bodies — the same input as Ball's
theorem". **That verdict is overturned.** No surface area is involved. The tilt remainder has
mean zero, `integral_vecTiltRemainder_eq_zero`, so a *constant* may be subtracted from the test
function for free; and near a point `v` at distance `≥ r` from the boundary the mollified
indicator *is* constant on the ball of radius `r`. Cauchy–Schwarz against the plain **Gaussian
tail** `γ{‖z‖ ≥ r/σ}` then localises the indicator half:
`abs_integral_mul_vecTiltRemainder_le_of_const_off` and
`abs_integral_shift_vecTiltRemainder_le_of_const_ball`, with `stdGaussian_norm_ge_le` (Markov at
any order) supplying the tail. All four are proved and axiom-clean; none of them mentions a
surface measure, and their constants are dimension-free.

**Why the hypothesis had to change.** Two corrections to the wave-24 interface, both forced by
the localisation just described and both *free* at the only call site:

1. *The shell must be two-sided.* The per-point weight is small exactly when `f` is constant on
   a ball about `v`, i.e. when `v` is outside the thickening **or inside the erosion**. The bad
   set is `B^s \ B_{-s}`, and its inner half `B \ B_{-s}` is invisible to the frozen hypothesis,
   which speaks only of `B^{2ε} \ interior B`.
2. *Every width must be controlled, not just `2ε`.* Step `j` of the telescope is smoothed at
   `σⱼ = √(j/n)`, and the localisation radius that step can afford is a multiple of `σⱼ`, not of
   `ε`. For `j > J = ⌈ε²n⌉` one has `σⱼ ≥ ε`, and for `j` near `n` one has `σⱼ ≈ 1 ≫ ε`; the
   frozen hypothesis says nothing about neighbourhoods at those scales.

`hybridLaw_wideShell_le` (wave 29, proved) supplies exactly the amended hypothesis at the call
site, at every width, with the constant `4 C_k` and the same `2Y` that brick H already carries —
so `exists_convexDiscrepancy_recursion`, `berryEsseen_convex_sharp` and its constant are
unaffected. Note that the amendment does not weaken the *content*: the frozen statement is true
(it is implied by Bentkus's theorem, since its right-hand side is `≥ A C_k β/√n`); what the
amendment records is the interface the *proof* needs.

## What is still missing (wave 29, re-derived)

Two items, both about the summand `y` rather than the geometry.

* **The `‖w‖ ≤ 1` restriction.** Both the wave-19 lemma and its wave-29 constant-off extension
  require a Cameron–Martin shift of length at most `1` (for `‖w‖ > 1` the `L²` norm of the tilt
  blows up like `e^{‖w‖²}` — see `integral_sq_tiltRemainder_le`). At step `j` the shift is
  `w = (c/σⱼ) y` with `c = n^{-1/2}`, i.e. `‖w‖ = ‖y‖/√j`, so the bound applies only on
  `{‖y‖ ≤ √j}`. Wave 24's claim that the wave-19 lemma "applies to `g` verbatim" is therefore
  also too optimistic. On `{‖y‖ > √j}` one must instead use the tilt identity directly:
  `∫ G R_w dγ = ∫ (G(· + w) − a) dγ − ∫ (G − a)·Q_w dγ`, whose second term is localised with the
  factor `1 + ‖w‖²  ≤ 2‖w‖³` and whose first term is localised *after averaging in `v`*, the
  mismatch `a_v ≠ a_{v + c y}` costing the mass of a `c‖y‖`-neighbourhood of `∂B`, i.e. again a
  two-sided shell, at width `c‖y‖ ≤ σⱼ‖w‖`. This is the reason the amended hypothesis is stated
  at *all* widths and not merely at the `σⱼ`.
* **The size of the summed weight.** With the per-step weight `C_k σⱼ + W`, the balanced sum
  `∑_{j>J} j^{-3/2}(C_k σⱼ + W)` contributes `β n^{-1/2}(C_k ∑_{J<j≤n} j^{-1} + W J^{-1/2})`,
  i.e. `δ (C_k · 2 log(1/ε) + W/ε)`. The logarithm is intrinsic to a single mollification width:
  killing it needs per-step widths `εⱼ ≍ σⱼ`, which the frozen single `f` cannot provide. So the
  conclusion this route will produce is
  `A δ (ε⁻¹(W + C_k ε) + C_k (1 + log (1/ε)))`, and the headline it feeds is the sharp rate up
  to one logarithm, `C_k (β/√n)(1 + log(√n/β))`. That is strictly better than the proved
  `(β/√n)^{1/2}` of `berryEsseen_convex_improved`. The conclusion below is left in its frozen
  (log-free) form: the extra term is not yet proved, and the frozen form is *true* (Bentkus), so
  weakening it now would be a guess rather than a forced amendment. If the Gaussian tail is used
  in its Markov form `stdGaussian_norm_ge_le p` with a *fixed* `p = 2m`, the logarithm is
  replaced by `ε^{-1/(m+1)}` and the headline by `(β/√n)^{m/(m+1)}`; the logarithm needs the
  tail at all orders at once. -/

**The wave-20 form of this statement is FALSE**, with the conclusion
`≤ A (β/√n) ε⁻¹ W` for the bare weight `W`. Witness (`k = 1`, `n = 1`, `ε = 1`, `p ↓ 0`): let
`ν` put mass `p` at `−a` and mass `1 − p` at `b`, with `a = √((1−p)/p)` and `b = √(p/(1−p))`, so
that `ν` is centred with unit variance and `β = ∫|y|³ dν ∼ p^{-1/2}`. Take `B = (−∞, −T]` with

* `∫ f dν = p` (the atom at `−a = −2T` lies in `B`, the atom at `b` lies off `Bᵋ`), while
  `∫ f dγ ≤ e^{−(T−1)²/2}`, so the left-hand side is `≥ p − e^{−(T−1)²/2}`;
* the right-hand side is `A · p^{-1/2} · 1 · 2 e^{−T²/2}` with `T = a/2 ∼ 1/(2√p)`, i.e.
  `∼ 2A p^{-1/2} e^{−1/(8p)}`.

As `p ↓ 0` the left-hand side is polynomially small and the right-hand side is exponentially
small, so no `A` works. The mechanism is that `W` is allowed to be *far below* the Gaussian
shell scale `C_k ε`, which no swap estimate can exploit: a hybrid law can miss the shell
entirely and still be far from Gaussian.

**The amendment** adds `C_k ε` to the weight, `C_k = gaussianShellConst k`. It costs nothing at
the only call site: `exists_convexDiscrepancy_recursion` invokes brick L with
`W = 4 C_k ε + 2 Y`, and `W + C_k ε ≤ (5/4) (4 C_k ε + 2 Y)` since `Y ≥ 0`, so the recursion is
unchanged except for a factor `2` in its constant. Every counterexample of the above shape is
killed, and the amended statement is what Bentkus's argument actually produces.

The proof splits at `W + C_k ε = 1`: above it,
`exists_smooth_swap_bound_of_one_le_weight` closes the goal with no localisation at all; below
it, the content is the named brick `localised_swap_bound_small_weight`.

**Wave 29 amended the weight hypothesis** (only; the conclusion is unchanged). `W` is no longer
a bound on the mass of the single outer shell `B^{2ε} \ interior B`, but on the excess over
`4 C_k s` of the mass of the *two-sided* shell `B^s \ B_{-s}`, **at every width `s > 0`**. Both
changes are forced by the localisation the proof actually uses — see the analysis on
`localised_swap_bound_small_weight` — and both are free here, because
`hybridLaw_wideShell_le` proves exactly that, at every width, with the same `2Y`. -/

/-- **The recursion, produced.** For every measurable convex `B`, every cut `ε > 0` and every
bound `Y` on the discrepancies at the neighbour sizes `n/2 ≤ m ≤ n`,

`Δ(μₙ, γ) ≤ A (β/√n) ε⁻¹ (C ε + 2Y) + C ε`, `C = 4 C_k`,

which is exactly the hypothesis of `le_of_selfImproving_induction`. Bricks H and L supply the
weighted swap estimate; everything else here is the two-sided thickening/erosion sandwich of
`berryEsseen_convex_improved` with the mollifier of `exists_smoothed_convex_indicator`.

Wave 24: brick L now delivers the weight `W + C_k ε` rather than `W` (its wave-20 form is false,
see `exists_localised_swap_bound`). Since the call site supplies `W = 4 C_k ε + 2 Y` with
`Y ≥ 0`, one has `W + C_k ε ≤ 2 W`, so the extra term is absorbed by doubling `A`; the statement
here is unchanged.

Wave 29: brick L's weight hypothesis is now the *two-sided* shell at *every* width, supplied
here by `hybridLaw_wideShell_le` instead of `hybridLaw_shell_le`. The same `W = 4 C_k ε + 2 Y`
works verbatim, so the statement here is again unchanged. -/

/-- **The sharp convex Berry–Esseen bound.** For every dimension `k > 0` there is a constant `C`
with

`|μₙ(B) − γ(B)| ≤ C β/√n` for every measurable convex `B`,

i.e. Bentkus's rate, linear in `δ = β/√n`, with the dimension entering only through
`C = 18 A (4 C_k) = 72 A gaussianShellConst k`, `gaussianShellConst k = 4 e² √k`.

This is `exists_convexDiscrepancy_recursion` fed to `le_of_selfImproving_induction`. It is
**not** axiom-clean: after wave 24 it inherits exactly **one** stated-but-unproved brick,
`localised_swap_bound_small_weight` — the small-weight half of brick L (brick H,
`hybridLaw_shell_le`, is proved; the large-weight half of brick L,
`exists_smooth_swap_bound_of_one_le_weight`, is proved; brick L's wave-20 form was false and is
amended, see `exists_localised_swap_bound`). The best *proved* convex bound remains
`berryEsseen_convex_improved` at `(β/√n)^{1/2}`.

Note the `k`-power: `gaussianShellConst k = 4 e² √k`, so this route gives `C ∼ k^{1/2}`, not
Bentkus's `400 k^{1/4}`. Wave 22 removed the factor `k` that the coordinate-slice cover of
`gaussian_thickening_le` used to contribute (see `gaussian_le_of_gaussian_shift_cover`); the
remaining `√k` is the first absolute moment `E‖Z‖ ≤ √k` of the Gaussian shift, and closing the
gap to `k^{1/4}` needs Ball's Gaussian-surface-area theorem. Nothing in the recursion changes.
Per the provable-constants rule the statement records `k^{1/2}`. -/
