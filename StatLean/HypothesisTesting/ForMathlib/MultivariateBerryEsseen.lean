# A multivariate Berry–Esseen bound via Lindeberg swapping (honest, non-sharp)

This file develops the elementary "smooth the indicator + Lindeberg swap" route to a
multivariate Berry–Esseen bound, as suggested for
`StatLean.HypothesisTesting.GoodnessOfFit.SmoothTestLargeK`. The two statements quoted
there, `bentkus_berry_esseen_convex` (constant `400 k^{1/4}`) and
`bentkus_berry_esseen_ball` (dimension-free `C`), are **Bentkus (2003)**: a sharp,
research-level dimension factor obtained by Fourier analysis over convex bodies. They are
*not* reproduced here and are left sorried in that file.

What this file records instead is the strongest bound the elementary route yields *honestly*.
The single ingredient that is proved unconditionally and is genuinely dimension-free is the
**Gaussian slab (half-space) anti-concentration** bound:

`gaussian_slab_measure_le` — for a unit vector `u` and `a ≤ b`,
`N(0, I_k)({z : a < ⟪u,z⟫ ≤ b}) ≤ (b - a) / √(2π)`,

whose constant `1/√(2π)` carries **no dimension factor at all**. This is "step 3" of the
route for a half-space, and it is the one-dimensional marginal statement: the projection
`z ↦ ⟪u,z⟫` of `N(0,I_k)` is exactly `N(0,1)`, whose density is bounded by `1/√(2π)`.

## Honest accounting of the elementary route (see the module docstring below for the report)

The remaining two ingredients — the smoothed convex indicator with third-derivative bounds
(`ContDiffBump` convolution) and the third-order multivariate Lindeberg swap — are recorded
as **named `private` lemmas carrying a `sorry` and a precise `TODO`**; Mathlib v4.29.1 has no
multivariate Taylor remainder bound, which is the analytic obstruction. Crucially, even once
those are filled, the elementary balance of steps 2–3 does **not** reach the `β/√n` *rate* of
the frozen statements: optimising `ε` in `ε^{-3} β/√n + C ε` gives an error of order
`(β/√n)^{1/4}`, i.e. `n^{-1/8}`, not `n^{-1/2}`. That is a genuine feature of the mollifier
method (the sharp rate needs characteristic functions / Esseen's smoothing lemma), and it is
reported precisely rather than papered over.

/-- **Gaussian slab anti-concentration, dimension-free.** For a unit vector `u` and `a ≤ b`,
the standard multivariate Gaussian mass of the slab `{z : a < ⟪u,z⟫ ≤ b}` is at most
`(b - a)/√(2π)`. The constant carries no dimension factor: this is "step 3" of the Lindeberg
route for a half-space, and is exactly the one-dimensional marginal bound.

This is the honest ingredient the elementary convex-set Berry–Esseen argument would consume;
the dimension factor of Bentkus (2003) arises only from covering the boundary shell of a
general convex body by such slabs, which is not carried out here. -/
