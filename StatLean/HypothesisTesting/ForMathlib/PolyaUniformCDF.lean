# Pólya's theorem: pointwise convergence of distribution functions is uniform — ForMathlib brick

If nondecreasing functions `Fₙ : ℝ → ℝ` with limits `0` at `−∞` and `1` at `+∞` converge
pointwise to a **continuous** function `F` with the same tail limits, then the convergence is
**uniform** on `ℝ`:
$$ \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} |F_n(x) - F(x)| \longrightarrow 0 . $$

This is the bridge from "convergence in distribution" to "the approximation is uniform in the
argument", which every calibration argument (critical values, p-values, bootstrap thresholds)
needs before it may pass from a pointwise limit law to a statement about the level attained.

Mathlib-only; the conclusion is stated with Mathlib's `TendstoUniformly`.

**Reference.** Classical distribution-function theory; original sources in the bibliographic
comments below.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* Standard proof: fix `ε > 0` and choose a finite grid `x₀ < ⋯ < x_k` with `F x₀ < ε`,
  `F x_k > 1 − ε` and `F xᵢ₊₁ − F xᵢ < ε` (continuity of `F` plus the tail limits make this
  possible — this is the only place continuity is used). On the grid, pointwise convergence
  gives a uniform-in-`i` bound for large `n`; between grid points, monotonicity of `Fₙ` and of
  `F` interpolates it; on the two tails the tail limits of `F` and of each `Fₙ` close the
  argument.
* Monotonicity of the limit `F` is *not* a hypothesis: it is forced by monotonicity of the
  `Fₙ` together with pointwise convergence, and is derived in the proof body.
* The tail limits of the approximants (`hFn_atBot`, `hFn_atTop`) are genuinely needed and not
  cosmetic: `Fₙ = F − n·1_{(−∞,−n)}` is nondecreasing and converges pointwise to a continuous
  distribution function while `sup |Fₙ − F| = n → ∞`. The helper
  `mem_Icc_of_monotone_of_tendsto` is what those hypotheses are used through.

**Bibliographic comments.** The theorem is due to G. Pólya ("Über den zentralen Grenzwertsatz
der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung und das Momentenproblem," *Math. Z.* **8** (1920), 171–181),
where it is used to upgrade the central limit theorem to a uniform approximation statement.
