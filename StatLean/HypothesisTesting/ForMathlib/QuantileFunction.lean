# Quantile (generalized inverse) of a distribution function — ForMathlib brick

The **quantile function** of a nondecreasing `F : ℝ → ℝ` is
`quantile F p = inf {x | p ≤ F x}`. Three uses drive this file:

* the **Galois property** `quantile F p ≤ x ↔ p ≤ F x` (for right-continuous nondecreasing
  `F`), the workhorse identity behind every quantile computation;
* the **critical constants of a randomized test**: for a law `P` on `ℝ` and a level
  `α ∈ (0,1)` there are `C` and `γ ∈ [0,1]` with `P(C,∞) + γ·P{C} = α`, i.e. the level can
  always be met exactly by randomizing on the boundary atom (`exists_critical_constants`);
* **inverse-transform sampling** `quantile F` pushes the uniform law on `[0,1]` to `P`, and
  the two convergence statements (deterministic, and in probability for random distribution
  functions) that quantile-based calibration arguments consume.

Mathlib-only; nothing here mentions tests or models.

**Reference.** Classical distribution-function theory; original sources in the bibliographic
comments below.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* `quantile` uses the `Real.sInf` junk conventions: the infimum of an empty or
  unbounded-below set is `0`. Every statement below therefore carries either an explicit
  nonemptiness/bounded-below side condition or a hypothesis (`StrictMono F`, `F` a genuine
  distribution function, `0 < p < 1`) that rules the junk out. `map_quantile_uniform` is the
  one place where junk survives — at the two endpoints `p ∈ {0,1}` — and is harmless there,
  since a pushforward only depends on the map up to a Lebesgue-null set.
* Right continuity is written `ContinuousWithinAt F (Set.Ici y) y`; it is used exactly once,
  in the forward direction of `quantile_le_iff` (to know that the infimum is attained).
* `tendsto_quantile_of_tendsto` needs neither continuity of the limit `F` nor any tail
  behaviour of the approximants: strict monotonicity of `F` at the target point plus
  monotonicity of each approximant already gives the two-sided bracketing. The same
  bracketing, run under the measure, gives `tendstoInMeasure_quantile`; no measurability of
  the random distribution functions is required, because the argument only ever compares
  measures of nested sets.
* The concept layer of this area carries the same formula under the name `cdfPseudoInverse`
  (bootstrap data model). That duplicate predates this brick; the intended end state is for
  the concept-layer name to be an abbreviation of `quantile`, which the bottom layer cannot
  do itself (it must not import the concept layer).

**Bibliographic comments.** The generalized inverse of a distribution function and its Galois
property are classical folklore of measure-theoretic probability, with no single seminal
source; the quantile transform as a construction of a random variable with a prescribed law
goes back to the beginnings of the subject (cf. P. Lévy, *Théorie de l'addition des variables
aléatoires*, Gauthier-Villars, 1937). The existence of the boundary-randomization constants
`(C, γ)` realizing a prescribed level exactly is the device introduced by J. Neyman and
E. S. Pearson ("On the problem of the most efficient tests of statistical hypotheses,"
*Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A* **231** (1933), 289–337).

/-- **Critical constants of a randomized test.** For any law `P` on `ℝ` and any level
`α ∈ (0,1)` there are a threshold `C` and a boundary weight `γ ∈ [0,1]` with
`P(C,∞) + γ·P{C} = α`: the level `α` can always be attained *exactly* by rejecting above `C`
and randomizing with probability `γ` on the atom at `C`.

This is the existence statement that every "there is a level-`α` test of the following form"
argument needs; the atom term is what makes it an equality rather than an inequality. -/
