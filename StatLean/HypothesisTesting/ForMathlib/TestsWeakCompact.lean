# Weak compactness of the class of `[0,1]`-valued functions — ForMathlib brick

Over a **finite** measure `μ`, the set of (a.e.) `[0,1]`-valued elements of `L²(μ)` is convex,
norm-bounded and norm-closed, hence **weakly compact**; intersecting it with finitely many
linear (moment) constraints `⟪gᵢ, f⟫ = cᵢ` keeps it compact, and a linear functional therefore
attains its maximum on the constrained class. That existence statement is the analytic engine
behind every "there exists an optimal test subject to `m` side conditions" argument.

This file provides:

* `testClassL2 μ` — the `[0,1]`-valued elements of `L²(μ)`;
* `constrainedTestClassL2 μ g c` — the same, cut by the constraints `⟪gᵢ, f⟫ = cᵢ`;
* `toWeakDualL2 μ` — the Fréchet–Riesz embedding `f ↦ ⟪f, ·⟫` of `L²(μ)` into
  `WeakDual ℝ (L²(μ))`, in which the weak topology of `L²` is the ambient weak-* topology;
* compactness of the images of the two classes, and `exists_max_inner_of_constraints`.

**Packaging note.** Mathlib has the Banach–Alaoglu theorem for the weak-* topology on a dual
space (`WeakDual.isCompact_closedBall`), but no separate carrier for "the weak topology on a
Hilbert space". We therefore transport the class along the Fréchet–Riesz isometry
`InnerProductSpace.toDual` and state compactness of the *image* in `WeakDual ℝ (L²(μ))`. Since
`InnerProductSpace.toDual` and `StrongDual.toWeakDual` are both bijections, this loses nothing:
the image determines the class, and `exists_max_inner_of_constraints` — the statement the
consumers actually use — is phrased back in `L²` with no weak-dual vocabulary at all.

3.6.1`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* Intended route for `isCompact_toWeakDualL2_image_testClass`: (i) `μ` finite gives
  `‖f‖₂ ≤ √(μ univ)` for every `f` in the class, so the image sits inside a closed ball, which
  is weak-* compact by `WeakDual.isCompact_closedBall` (`ProperSpace ℝ`); (ii) the image is
  weak-* closed, because `toWeakDualL2` is *surjective* (Fréchet–Riesz) and the class is cut
  out by the weak-* closed conditions `0 ≤ L h` and `L h ≤ ⟪1, h⟫` ranging over the nonnegative
  `h ∈ L²(μ)` — each an intersection of preimages of closed half-lines under the continuous
  evaluations `L ↦ L h` (note `1 ∈ L²(μ)` because `μ` is finite); (iii) conclude with
  `IsCompact.of_isClosed_subset`. This avoids needing Mazur's theorem ("convex + norm-closed
  ⇒ weakly closed") explicitly.
* The constrained class adds `⋂ i, {L | L (g i) = c i}`, closed for the same reason; the index
  type is arbitrary (no finiteness needed for compactness — finiteness enters only when the
  constraints are produced by a finite family of moment conditions).
* `exists_max_inner_of_constraints` then applies `IsCompact.exists_isMaxOn` to the continuous
  evaluation at `h` and transports the maximizer back along the injective `toWeakDualL2`.
* Everything is stated for the real field; `⟪·,·⟫_ℝ` is the `InnerProductSpace`-scoped
  notation, and on real `L²` it reduces to `∫ f·g dμ` (see `toWeakDualL2_apply_eq_integral`;
  recall that `RCLike.inner_apply` produces the factors in the opposite order).

**Bibliographic comments.** Weak-* compactness of the closed unit ball of a dual space is the
Banach–Alaoglu theorem (S. Banach, *Théorie des opérations linéaires*, Warszawa, 1932, for the
separable case; L. Alaoglu, "Weak topologies of normed linear spaces," *Ann. of Math.* **41**
(1940), 252–267, in general). The self-duality of Hilbert space used to transport it is the
Fréchet–Riesz representation theorem (F. Riesz, *C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris* **144** (1907),
1409–1411; M. Fréchet, *ibid.*, 1414–1416). Its use to produce optimal tests under finitely
many side conditions is the generalized-fundamental-lemma argument of J. Neyman and
E. S. Pearson ("On the problem of the most efficient tests of statistical hypotheses,"
*Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A* **231** (1933), 289–337).
