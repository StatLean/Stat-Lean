# Riemann–Lebesgue, uniformly over a family

The Riemann–Lebesgue lemma says that the oscillatory integral `∫ f(x) e^{isx} dx` of a fixed
`L¹` function tends to `0` as `|s| → ∞`. Several applications need the convergence to be
**uniform over a family of `L¹` functions** — most notably the multivariate Cramér condition
for a law carried by a curve, where the family is the set of projections of the law onto the
directions of a compact sphere.

Uniformity is false for an arbitrary family (translates `f(· − a)`, `a ∈ ℝ`, all have the same
modulus of transform, and the transform of a *single* function does not decay uniformly along
any family that is not relatively compact). It is true, and easy, on a **totally bounded**
subset of `L¹`: approximate every member of the family to within `ε/2` by one of finitely many
functions, apply Riemann–Lebesgue to each of those, and use that the transform is a contraction
from `L¹` to `L^∞`.

## Contents

* `fourierOsc` — the oscillatory integral `∫ e^{i x s} f(x) dx`, normalised exactly as `charFun`
  is, so that `charFun (volume.withDensity p) = fourierOsc p`;
* `tendsto_fourierOsc_cocompact` — the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma in this normalisation, obtained
  from Mathlib's `Real.tendsto_integral_exp_smul_cocompact` by the reparametrisation
  `s = −2πw`;
* `norm_fourierOsc_sub_le` — the contraction property `‖ℱf(s) − ℱg(s)‖ ≤ ‖f − g‖_{L¹}`,
  valid for every `s`;
* `eventually_norm_fourierOsc_le_of_totallyBounded` — **the headline**: Riemann–Lebesgue holds
  uniformly over any family admitting finite `ε`-nets in `L¹`;
* `exists_finset_l1Net_of_isCompact` — a family parametrised continuously (in `L¹`) by a
  compact set admits finite `ε`-nets;
* `eventually_norm_fourierOsc_le_of_isCompact` — the two combined, in the form applications
  consume;
* `quadPhaseInt`, `eventually_norm_quadPhaseInt_le` — the application to a **quadratic phase**:
  for a fixed `L¹` density `f`, `∫ f(y) e^{i(t₀y + t₁y²)} dy → 0` as `|t₀| → ∞`, uniformly over
  `|t₁| ≤ M`. This is the "linear regime" of the two-regime decomposition of the multivariate
  Cramér condition for a parabola-carried law;
* `autoCorr`, `sq_ofReal_norm_quadPhaseInt`, `exists_bound_norm_quadPhaseInt_large` — the
  complementary regime `|t₁| → ∞`, **uniformly in `t₀`**. This is *not* a Riemann–Lebesgue
  statement about the twists `e^{it₁y²}f` (they are not relatively compact in `L¹` over an
  unbounded set of `t₁`), and it is proved instead through the **autocorrelation identity**
  `|I|² = ∫ e^{i(t₀h + t₁h²)} ℱg_h(2t₁h) dh` with `g_h(z) = f(z + h)\overline{f(z)}`, which
  moves the oscillation into the *frequency* `2t₁h` of an ordinary Fourier transform and leaves
  `t₀` inside a unimodular factor;
* `exists_bound_norm_quadPhaseInt_of_integrable` — the two regimes combined, with no hypothesis
  on `f` beyond `f ∈ L¹`: `|∫ f(y)e^{i(t₀y + t₁y²)}dy| ≤ ε` once `|t₀| + |t₁|` is large.

## Proof formalization notes

* The `L¹`-continuity hypothesis of `exists_finset_l1Net_of_isCompact` is phrased elementarily,
  as `∀ δ > 0, ∃ U ∈ 𝓝[K] a, ∀ b ∈ U, ∫ ‖f b − f a‖ ≤ δ`, rather than through `MeasureTheory.Lp`
  and its quotient by a.e. equality. Nothing is lost — the applications produce exactly this
  statement, from dominated convergence — and it avoids having to lift a family of honest
  functions into the `Lp` quotient and back.
* The `ε`-net hypothesis is likewise stated as a `Finset` of *indices* rather than of `L¹`
  elements, which is what a finite subcover of a compact parameter set produces.

Riemann–Lebesgue applied to each of the finitely many net elements, and the second is small by

/-! ## The application: an oscillatory integral with a quadratic phase

For a law carried by the parabola `y ↦ (y, y²)` — the law of `(X − μ, (X − μ)² − σ²)` that the
studentized Edgeworth expansion runs on — the characteristic function in the direction
`t = (t₀, t₁)` is, up to a unimodular factor, `∫ f(y) e^{i(t₀y + t₁y²)} dy` with `f` the density
of `X − μ`. A multivariate Cramér condition asks for this to stay away from `1` as `‖t‖ → ∞`,
uniformly.

Two regimes have to be treated separately, and only the first is a Riemann–Lebesgue statement:

* `|t₁|` bounded. Then `‖t‖ → ∞` forces `|t₀| → ∞`, and the integral is the Fourier transform,
  at frequency `t₀`, of the **twisted density** `y ↦ e^{it₁y²}f(y)`. The twists form a family
  parametrised by the compact interval `|t₁| ≤ M`, continuously in `L¹` — dominated convergence,
  with dominating function `2‖f‖` — so `eventually_norm_fourierOsc_le_of_isCompact` applies and
  gives decay uniform in `t₁`. That is `eventually_norm_quadPhaseInt_le` below.
* `|t₁| → ∞`. Here the phase is genuinely quadratic and no `L¹` family is compact: the twists
  `e^{it₁y²}f` oscillate away from each other in `L¹`. The classical estimate is van der
  Corput's second-derivative test; what is proved below instead is the soft **autocorrelation
  identity** `|I|² = ∫ e^{i(t₀h + t₁h²)} ĝ_h(2t₁h) dh` with `g_h(z) = f(z + h)\overline{f(z)}`,
  which needs no smoothness, no compact support and no bounded variation — dominated convergence
  in `h` against `‖g_h‖₁` (integrable, with `∫‖g_h‖₁ dh = ‖f‖₁²`) takes `|t₁| → ∞`. -/

/-! ### The large-coefficient regime, via the autocorrelation identity

The complementary regime `|t₁| → ∞` is *not* a Riemann–Lebesgue statement about the twists
`e^{it₁y²}f`: as `t₁` ranges over an unbounded set those twists are not relatively compact in
`L¹`, so no `ε`-net exists and the argument of the previous section has nothing to bite on.

What is true — and this is the content of the section — is that the estimate holds for **every**
`f ∈ L¹`, uniformly in the linear coefficient `t₀`, by the autocorrelation identity

`|I(t₀,t₁)|² = ∫ e^{i(t₀h + t₁h²)} · ℱg_h(2t₁h) dh`,  `g_h(z) = f(z + h)\overline{f(z)}`.

The identity is elementary: `I \overline{I}` is a double integral over `(y,z)`, the substitution
`y = z + h` (translation invariance of Lebesgue measure in the *inner* variable — no
two-dimensional change of variables is needed) turns the phase into
`t₀h + t₁h² + 2t₁hz`, and Fubini exchanges the order. Fubini is licensed by
`∫∫|f(z + h)f(z)| dz dh = ‖f‖₁²`.

The estimate then follows by dominated convergence in `t₁` along `cocompact ℝ`: for each fixed
`h ≠ 0` the inner frequency `2t₁h` leaves every compact set, so `ℱg_h(2t₁h) → 0` by the ordinary
Riemann–Lebesgue lemma, while `‖ℱg_h(2t₁h)‖ ≤ ‖g_h‖₁` is an integrable dominating function of
`h`. Crucially the linear coefficient `t₀` survives only inside a unimodular factor, so the
resulting bound is uniform in `t₀` — which is exactly what the multivariate Cramér condition for
a parabola-carried law needs and what van der Corput's second-derivative test would otherwise
have to supply. -/
