# The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test: calibration and consistency

For i.i.d. real observations `X₁,…,Xₙ` with c.d.f. `F` and a fully specified null c.d.f.
`F₀`, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic is
$$ T_n \;=\; \sup_{t\in\mathbb R} n^{1/2}\bigl|\hat F_n(t) - F_0(t)\bigr|
        \;=\; n^{1/2}\, d_K(\hat F_n, F_0), $$
where `d_K` is the sup (Kolmogorov) distance between distribution functions. This file
fixes the statistic (`ksStat`), fixes a **calibration** of the critical value, and states
the level and power theorems:

* `ksStat` — the statistic `Tₙ` above, built on the empirical c.d.f.;
* `ksThreshold` — the calibrated critical value (see the calibration note below);
* `ks_dkw_level` — the calibrated test has level `α` at every sample size;
* `ks_consistent` — pointwise consistency against every fixed `F ≠ F₀`;
* `ks_uniform_power` — power `→ 1` uniformly over `n^{1/2} d_K(F, F₀) ≥ εₙ → ∞`;
* `ks_power_lower_bound` — the nonasymptotic power bound behind the previous item.

**Calibration decision (documented deviation).** The classical calibration takes the
critical value to be the `1 − α` quantile `s_{n,1−α}` of the null law of `Tₙ`, whose
asymptotics rest on the Kolmogorov limit law
`P{Tₙ > d} → 2 ∑_{k≥1} (−1)^{k+1} exp(−2k²d²)`. We deliberately avoid that limit law and
calibrate instead through the uniform deviation bound of the sibling brick
`ForMathlib/DKWUniform`. Consequences, all of them documented deviations:

1. `ksThreshold α` does **not** depend on `n`; the level statement is nonasymptotic, and
   the classical step "`s_{n,1−α} → s_{1−α} < ∞`" disappears from every proof below.
2. No continuity assumption on `F₀` is needed anywhere in this file. (The classical
   calibration is distribution-free only for continuous `F₀`; for a discontinuous `F₀` it
   is conservative.)
3. The constants are not sharp. The sharp tail is `2 exp(−2d²)`; the brick delivers
   `4 exp(−d²/16)`, so the calibrated threshold is larger than the classical one and the
   nonasymptotic power bound below carries `4` and `(ε − s)²/16` in place of the classical
   `2` and `2(ε − s)²`. The test remains of level `α` — it is conservative, not wrong.

**Coupling with `ForMathlib/DKWUniform` (single point of contact).** `ksThreshold` is
defined by solving, for `s`, the equation `C e^{−c s²} = α` with the constants `C = 4`,
`c = 1/16` of that brick's `dkw_uniform`:
$$ \mathbb P\bigl\{\, n^{1/2} d_K(\hat F_n, F) \;\ge\; d \,\bigr\}
   \;\le\; 4\, e^{-d^{2}/16}, \qquad d \ge 0, $$
uniformly in `n ≥ 1` and in the sampling law. If those constants are sharpened, the *only*
edit required is the numeral `16 * Real.log (4 / α)` in `ksThreshold`: every statement in
this file and in `KSLocalPower.lean` continues to hold verbatim, because each of them is
phrased through `ksThreshold` and re-derives the level from the same equation.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* `ksStat` reuses `MultipleTesting.empiricalCDF` (the counting c.d.f. `card {j | Xⱼ ≤ t}/n`)
  and the frozen `supCDFDist` of `Bootstrap/Defs.lean`, so the KS statistic, the bootstrap
  Kolmogorov distance and the multiple-testing empirical c.d.f. are the same objects.
* The sibling brick states its bound through its own `empCDF` / `ksDist`. The two
  presentations are reconciled once and for all by `empiricalCDF_eq_empCDF` and
  `ksStat_eq_sqrt_mul_ksDist`, which every proof below routes through; no statement in
  this file mentions `ksDist`.
* The rejection event involves an uncountable supremum. Rather than assuming its
  measurability at every use site, it is derived once in `measurable_ksStat` from right
  continuity of `F₀` (the empirical c.d.f. is right continuous by construction), i.e. the
  real supremum is a rational supremum.
* Null and alternative c.d.f.s are identified with Mathlib's `cdf` of the corresponding
  law by a single hypothesis `∀ t, F t = cdf μ t`; this supplies right continuity,
  monotonicity and the identification simultaneously.
* `ks_uniform_power` is stated in **sequence form**: the classical statement is an
  infimum of powers over the class `{F : n^{1/2} d_K(F, F₀) ≥ εₙ}`, and the two are
  equivalent (an infimum of a bounded family tends to `1` iff the value along every
  admissible selection does). The sequence form is also the form the classical proof
  argues in, and it is the form that types: each alternative carries its own sampling law,
  i.e. a triangular array `X : (n : ℕ) → Fin n → Ω → ℝ`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The statistic and its limit law are due to A. N. Kolmogorov
("Sulla determinazione empirica di una legge di distribuzione," *Giornale dell'Istituto
Italiano degli Attuari* **4** (1933), 83–91); the two-sample and further distribution
theory to N. V. Smirnov ("Table for estimating the goodness of fit of empirical
distributions," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **19** (1948), 279–281). The uniform deviation
inequality used for the calibration is due to A. Dvoretzky, J. Kiefer and J. Wolfowitz
("Asymptotic minimax character of the sample distribution function and of the classical
multinomial estimator," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **27** (1956), 642–669), with the sharp
constant obtained by P. Massart ("The tight constant in the Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz
inequality," *Ann. Probab.* **18** (1990), 1269–1283). The second, elementary consistency
argument transcribed in `ks_consistent` goes back to F. J. Massey ("A note on the power of
a non-parametric test," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **21** (1950), 440–443).

/-- The **two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic**
`Tₙ = sup_t n^{1/2} |F̂ₙ(t) − F₀(t)| = n^{1/2} d_K(F̂ₙ, F₀)` of a sample `X` against the
fully specified null c.d.f. `F₀`. Built on `MultipleTesting.empiricalCDF` (the empirical
c.d.f. `F̂ₙ`) and on `supCDFDist` (the Kolmogorov distance `d_K`). For `n = 0` the
empirical c.d.f. is identically `0` and the statistic is `0` (junk, guarded by `0 < n`
side conditions everywhere below). -/
noncomputable def ksStat {n : ℕ} (X : Fin n → Ω → ℝ) (F₀ : ℝ → ℝ) (ω : Ω) : ℝ :=

/-- The **DKW-calibrated critical value** of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test at level `α`:
the solution `s` of `4 · exp(−s²/16) = α`, i.e.
$$ s_\alpha \;=\; \sqrt{16\,\log(4/\alpha)} . $$
It is a constant: it does not depend on the sample size, on the null c.d.f., or on the
sampling law. Degenerate inputs (`α ≤ 0`) fall back on the junk conventions of `Real.log`
and `Real.sqrt`; every statement below carries `0 < α < 1`.

COUPLING: the numerals `4` and `16` are the constants `C` and `1/c` of `dkw_uniform` in
`ForMathlib/DKWUniform`; see the module docstring for the reconciliation rule.

DOCUMENTED DEVIATION (constant, not statement). This definition previously read
`√(8 log(4/α))`, matching the frozen `dkw_uniform` exponent `c = 1/8`. That exponent was
*not* provable: the only elementary route to the in-expectation half of the DKW inequality
(symmetrisation, the sorted-prefix `±1` walk, and Lévy's maximal inequality) delivers
`√n · E Dₙ ≤ 4`, and `M = 4` provably breaks `4 e^{−d²/8}` on the band `d ∈ (3.330, 4)`.
Per the charter rule *state the constants that are actually provable*, `dkw_uniform` was
amended to `4 e^{−d²/16}` and this numeral to `16`; see the `ForMathlib/DKWUniform` header
for the full accounting and for the martingale route that would restore `8`. The effect is
that every calibrated threshold in this file is `√2` times larger, i.e. the tests are more
conservative; every statement below is phrased through `ksThreshold` and re-derives its
level from `4 e^{−s²/16} = α`, so all of them hold verbatim. -/

This is the calibrated form of the classical nonasymptotic bound
`P{Tₙ > s} ≥ 1 − 2 exp(−2(ε − s)²)`, with the same hypothesis `s < ε` and the constants of
the sibling brick in place of the sharp ones (documented deviation; see the module
docstring). Both come from the same two lines: the triangle inequality
`d_K(F, F₀) ≤ d_K(F, F̂ₙ) + d_K(F̂ₙ, F₀)` turns the event `n^{1/2} d_K(F̂ₙ, F) < ε − s`
into a rejection, and the deviation inequality bounds its complement. -/

/-- **Uniform consistency in power.** The power of the calibrated Kolmogorov–Smirnov test
tends to one uniformly over the alternatives `F` with `n^{1/2} d_K(F, F₀) ≥ εₙ`, whenever
`εₙ → ∞`.

Stated in sequence form (see the module docstring): the classical infimum over the class
of admissible alternatives at stage `n` is replaced by an arbitrary selection `μ n` of
sampling laws satisfying the constraint, carried by a triangular array `X n` of
observations. Specialising to a constant selection recovers uniform consistency over
`d_K(F, F₀) ≥ ϵ` for each fixed `ϵ > 0`. -/

/-! ### Pointwise consistency against a fixed alternative -/

/-- **Pointwise consistency of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.** Against any fixed
alternative `F ≠ F₀` — equivalently, any `F` at positive Kolmogorov distance from `F₀` —
the power of the calibrated test tends to one.

The classical proof runs the Glivenko–Cantelli theorem (`d_K(F̂ₙ, F) → 0` a.s., hence
`Tₙ → ∞` a.s.) together with `s_{n,1−α} → s_{1−α} < ∞`; under the calibration of this file
the second ingredient is vacuous, since the critical value is a constant. Here the fixed
alternative is the constant selection of `ks_uniform_power` (`μ n = μ`, `F n = F`), whose
diverging separation `εₙ = √n · d_K(F, F₀) → ∞` is supplied by `d_K(F, F₀) > 0`. -/
