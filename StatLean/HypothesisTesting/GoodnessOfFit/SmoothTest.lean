# Smooth tests of fit: the fixed-`k` theory

To test a fully specified null law `P₀` on an arbitrary sample space, embed it in the
`k`-parameter exponential family of densities with respect to `P₀`
$$ p_\theta(x) \;=\; C_k(\theta)\,
     \exp\Bigl(\sum_{j=1}^{k} \theta_j\, \psi_j(x)\Bigr), \qquad \theta \in \mathbb R^k, $$
where `ψ₁, …, ψ_k` — together with the constant function `ψ₀ = 1` — are orthonormal in
`L²(P₀)`. The null hypothesis is `θ = 0`, and the score test for it rejects for large
values of
$$ S_n \;=\; \sum_{j=1}^{k} Z_{n,j}^2, \qquad
   Z_{n,j} \;=\; n^{-1/2}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \psi_j(X_i). $$
This is the smooth test. It is the score (Rao) test of the embedding family, whence its
optimality; and it contains the chi-squared test of the previous files as the special case
of a multinomial sample space with `ψ` the standardized cell indicators.

Contents:

* `smoothModel` — the embedding exponential family, built through the point-estimation
  area's `ExpFamily.ofDensity` over the base `P₀`;
* `smoothScore`, `smoothStat` — the score components `Z_{n,j}` and the statistic `Sₙ`;
* `smoothStat_weakConverges_chiSquared` — under `P₀`, `Sₙ ⇒ χ²_k`;
* `smoothTest_maximin_upper_bound` — no asymptotically level-`α` test beats
  `P{χ²_k(b²) > c_{k,1−α}}` in minimum power over `b ≤ |h| ≤ B`;
* `smoothTest_asymptotically_maximin` — the smooth test attains that value.

The last two are the instances of `AsymptoticMaximin.asymptotic_maximin_upper_bound` in
which the information matrix is the identity: orthonormality of the `ψⱼ` in `L²(P₀)` makes
the Fisher information of the embedding family at `θ = 0` equal to `Iₖ`, so the local shell
of the transfer lemma is the Euclidean shell `b ≤ |h| ≤ B` and the maximin value is the
same noncentral chi-squared number that appeared for Pearson's test.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* `smoothModel` is `ExpFamily.ofDensity P₀ 1 ψ⃗ _`: the carrier is trivial and the base of
  the exponential family is `P₀` itself (`P₀.withDensity 1 = P₀`, a lemma at the point of
  use, not a definitional equality). The natural statistic is the vector
  `x ↦ (ψ₁ x, …, ψ_k x)` in `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)`, so `E.P θ` is exactly the density
  displayed above, with `A(θ) = −log C_k(θ)` the log-partition function. The prototype —
  testing uniformity on `[0,1]` with normalized Legendre polynomials — is the case
  `P₀ = ` uniform, and nothing in this file is special to it.
* Orthonormality is recorded as two hypotheses: `∫ ψᵢψⱼ dP₀ = δᵢⱼ` and `∫ ψⱼ dP₀ = 0`. The
  second is orthogonality to the constant function `ψ₀ = 1` and is what makes the score at
  `θ = 0` centred; it is a consequence of the first only if the constant is included in
  the system, which is why it is stated separately.
* `θ = 0` is required to be an interior point of the natural parameter set — the full-rank
  condition making the family q.m.d. at the null and its information matrix invertible.
* The score is scaled as `n^{-1/2} ∑ᵢ ψⱼ(Xᵢ)` rather than as a derivative of the
  log-likelihood: the identification of the two (the derivative of the log-partition
  function vanishes at `θ = 0` because `E₀ψⱼ = 0`) is a lemma about `smoothModel`, not
  part of the definition of the statistic.
* The local experiments of the two maximin statements are carried as data `Q n h` and tied
  to `smoothModel` by the requirement that the observations be i.i.d. with law
  `E.P (n^{-1/2} • h)`; this is the same format as in `ChiSquaredMaximin.lean`.
* The upper bound is stated for a finite outer radius `B`. The unbounded case `B = ∞`
  follows a fortiori, the infimum over a larger set being smaller. The *attainment* half,
  in contrast, genuinely needs `B < ∞` in general; it extends to `B = ∞` under the extra
  condition that `Var_θ[ψⱼ(X₁)]` be bounded uniformly in `θ` — automatic when the `ψⱼ` are
  bounded functions, as they are for the Legendre system.

**Bibliographic comments.** The smooth test, the embedding family, and the asymptotic
maximin property against the alternatives it generates are due to J. Neyman ("Smooth test
for goodness of fit," *Skandinavisk Aktuarietidskrift* **20** (1937), 149–199). The score
statistic it specialises is due to C. R. Rao ("Large sample tests of statistical hypotheses
concerning several parameters with applications to problems of estimation," *Proc. Camb.
Phil. Soc.* **44** (1948), 50–57). The reduction of the local optimality question to a
Gaussian shift experiment follows L. Le Cam (*Univ. California Publ. Statist.* **3**
(1960), 37–98); the special case in which the statistic reduces to Pearson's is due to
K. Pearson (*Phil. Mag.* **50** (1900), 157–175). Later developments, including data-driven
choice of `k`, are surveyed in J. C. W. Rayner and D. J. Best, *Smooth Tests of Goodness of
Fit*, Oxford University Press, 1989.

/-! ### The embedding family and the statistic -/

/-- The **smooth model**: the `k`-parameter exponential family through the score functions
`ψ₁, …, ψ_k`, with densities `C_k(θ) exp(∑ⱼ θⱼ ψⱼ(x))` with respect to the null law `P₀`.

Built with the point-estimation area's `ExpFamily.ofDensity` with trivial carrier, so that
the base measure of the family is `P₀` itself and the natural statistic is the vector of
score functions. The null hypothesis is the canonical parameter `θ = 0`, at which the
member measure is `P₀`. -/

its components are asymptotically uncorrelated (because `∫ ψᵢψⱼ dP₀ = 0` for `i ≠ j`).

/-! #### Vectorised scores and the multivariate CLT brick

The null-limit proof mirrors `GoodnessOfFit/ChiSquaredMultinomial.lean`. The score functions
are already centred in `L²(P₀)` (`E₀ψⱼ = 0`) with covariance the identity (`∫ψᵢψⱼ = δᵢⱼ`),
so the per-observation vector `psiVec x = (ψ₁ x, …, ψ_k x)` has mean zero and covariance
`Iₖ`; the standardised sum converges to `N(0, Iₖ)` and the squared norm is `Sₙ`. -/

/-- **Multivariate CLT for the score vector** (the single deep analytic brick of the
null-limit proof). Under `P₀`, with the score functions orthonormal and centred in `L²(P₀)`,
the standardised score vector converges in law to the standard Gaussian `N(0, Iₖ)`.

The proof realises `scoreVec` as the standardised sum of the per-observation score vectors
`psiVec x = (ψⱼ x)ⱼ` (`scoreVec_eq_smul_sum`), transfers the per-stage law to the canonical
infinite-product i.i.d. model produced by `ProbabilityTheory.exists_iid` (matching both
sequences to `(Measure.pi …).map` via `iIndepFun_iff_map_fun_eq_pi_map`), and applies the
reusable fixed-i.i.d. CLT `AsymptoticStatistics.ParametricFamily.ScoreCLT.clt_finDim`. The
zero-mean side-condition is `hcentred`, and the covariance side-condition
`∫ ⟪u, g⟫⟪v, g⟫ = u ⬝ᵥ Iₖ v` is `hortho`. -/

/-! ### The null limiting distribution -/

/-- **Null limit of the smooth statistic.** For an i.i.d. sample from the null law `P₀`
and score functions orthonormal in `L²(P₀)` and orthogonal to the constants, the smooth
statistic converges in law to `χ²_k`. Hence the test rejecting when `Sₙ > c_{k,1−α}` is
asymptotically of level `α`.

This is the multivariate central limit theorem for the score vector (`Zₙ ⇒ N(0, Iₖ)`)

/-! ### Bricks for the maximin upper bound

The upper bound is the instance of `AsymptoticMaximin.asymptotic_maximin_upper_bound` in which
the local experiments are the canonical i.i.d. experiments of the smooth model.  The bricks
below supply, in order: the coordinate form of the inner product against the score vector; the
elementary real inequalities behind the quadratic expansion of the log-partition function; the
sign-vector envelope that makes every exponential moment finite; the expansion itself; the
weak limit of the canonical score law; and the explicit exponential-tilt representation of the
members of the smooth model. -/

  -- local-asymptotic-normality link between `Q n h` and the sample.  The minimal repair is to
  -- restrict the competitors to tests based on the sample, which is `hφX` and is how the
  -- source states the theorem (Neyman 1937; TSH4 §16.4.1).
  --
  -- PROOF.  Transfer along `hφX` to the CANONICAL experiment `QC n h = ⨂_{i<n} p_{h n^{-1/2}}`
  -- on `Fin n → 𝓧` (the varying sample space that `asymptotic_maximin_upper_bound` now allows),
  -- where `hindep` + `hlaw` identify the law of the sample and hence the power function; the
  -- competitor is the `[0,1]`-truncation of the function of the sample supplied by `hφX`, which
  -- agrees with `φ n` on the sample because `φ n` is a critical function.  On the canonical
  -- experiment every ingredient is explicit:
  -- • `hlaw` at `n = 1` forces every member `p_θ` to be a probability measure, so every
  --   exponential tilt is `P₀`-integrable and the natural parameter set is the whole space —
  --   `hint` is therefore not needed, and is kept only because it is part of the frozen
  --   signature;
  -- • the log-likelihood field is `L n h d = ∑_{i<n} (⟪n^{-1/2}h, ψ(dᵢ)⟫ − A(n^{-1/2}h))`,
  --   jointly measurable because `A` is measurable by Fubini;
  -- • `Zₙ ⇒ N(0, Iₖ)` is `scoreVec_weakConverges_gaussian` transported to the product law;
  -- • the LAN remainder is DETERMINISTIC, `n A(n^{-1/2}h) − b²/2`, the family being linear in
  --   the sufficient statistic, so the envelope `D n` is the constant `C b³/√n`; the estimate
  --   `|A(θ) − ‖θ‖²/2| ≤ C‖θ‖³` on the ball of radius `b` is `logPartition_quadratic_bound`,
  --   proved above by an elementary third-order Taylor bound on `e^z` together with the moment
  --   identities `∫⟪θ,ψ⟫ dP₀ = 0` and `∫⟪θ,ψ⟫² dP₀ = ‖θ‖²` supplied by `hcentred`/`hortho`.
  -- The bounded shell `{b ≤ ‖h‖ ≤ B}` contains the least-favourable sphere `‖h‖ = b` (here
  -- `b < B`), which is what the shell-parametrised form of the transfer lemma requires.

/-! ### Bricks for the attainment half

The attainment half needs the local limit law of the score vector under a *drifting* local
parameter `hₙ → h₀`.  That is Le Cam's third lemma applied to the exponential tilt: the
log-likelihood ratio of the `n`-fold product `p_{hₙ/√n}` against `P₀ⁿ` is the *exact* affine
function `⟪hₙ, Zₙ⟫ − n·A(hₙ/√n)` of the score vector `Zₙ`, so the joint weak limit of
`(Zₙ, Lₙ)` under the null follows from `pi_scoreLaw_weakConverges` plus a Slutsky step, and
the uniform-integrability hypothesis of Le Cam 3 follows from the exact second-moment
identity `∫ exp(2Lₙ) dP₀ⁿ = exp(n·A(2hₙ/√n) − 2n·A(hₙ/√n))`, bounded because
`n·A(θₙ) → ‖h₀‖²/2` by `logPartition_quadratic_bound`.  The tilted limit is then the
Cameron–Martin shift `N(h₀, Iₖ)`. -/

end Attainment

/-- **The smooth test attains the maximin value on the local shell** (LIFTED — the deep half
of `smoothTest_asymptotically_maximin`). Under the local alternatives `θ = h n^{-1/2}` with
`b ≤ |h| ≤ B`, the minimum power of the smooth test `1{Sₙ > c}` converges to
`P{χ²_k(b²) > c_{k,1−α}}`.

TODO (genuine deep gap): this is the noncentral analogue of
`smoothStat_weakConverges_chiSquared`. Its intended proof is: (i) the weak limit of `Sₙ`
under the *local alternatives* is `χ²_k(‖h‖²)` — a multivariate *triangular-array* CLT
giving `scoreVec ⇒ N((hⱼ)ⱼ, Iₖ)`, hence `Sₙ ⇒ χ²_k(‖h‖²)` by the same continuous-mapping /
`multivariateGaussian_map_inner_inv_eq_noncentralChiSquared` bridge used in the null case;
(ii) the map `h ↦ P{χ²_k(‖h‖²) > c}` is increasing in `‖h‖` (`noncentralChiSquared_tail_mono`),
so the minimum over the shell is asymptotically attained at the inner boundary `‖h‖ = b`,
giving `P{χ²_k(b²) > c}`.

TODO (re-derived).  The triangular-array CLT is no longer the obstruction: its multinomial
twin `ChiSquaredMultinomial.reducedCount_weakConverges_noncentral` is now CLOSED, by running
the drifting-row multivariate limit law `HypothesisTesting.meanVec_root_tendsto` on the
sequence of per-observation laws.  The same route applies here, with `F n` the law of
`psiVec` under the *tilted* member `(smoothModel P₀ ψ hψ).P (n^{-1/2} • h)`: what has to be
supplied for it is the class condition `meanVecSeqClass`, i.e. that the exponential tilt
`p_{θ}` converges weakly to `P₀` with mean vector `→ h` and covariance `→ Iₖ` as `θ → 0`
along `θ = n^{-1/2}h`.  That is a differentiability-in-quadratic-mean statement about
`smoothModel`, and needs `PointEstimation.ExponentialFamily.Smoothness` (the log-partition
`A` and its first two derivatives at `0`), which is not imported here.  The two remaining
obstructions are therefore (a) that exponential-family expansion, and (b) the pinning of the
shell infimum to the inner boundary.

TODO (RE-DERIVED again, this batch).  This half is about the *smooth test itself*, a
function of the sample alone, so it is untouched by the abstract-`Q` counterexample that
made `smoothTest_maximin_upper_bound` false as frozen: the frozen hypotheses determine the
law of `smoothStat ψ (X n)` under every `Q n h`, hence the whole statement.  It is TRUE and
open.  Note that the mixture apparatus closed this batch
(`AsymptoticMaximin.asymptotic_maximin_upper_bound`) does NOT help here: it bounds every
competitor from ABOVE, whereas this is an attainment statement.  What it does do is remove
the second obstruction from the *upper-bound* half, so the two halves no longer share a
debt.  Obstruction (b) has shrunk further: besides `noncentralChiSquared_tail_mono`, the
strictly stronger monotone likelihood ratio of the noncentral chi-squared family in the
noncentrality is now available (`exists_monotone_density`, in the MLR section of
`ChiSquaredMaximin.lean`), so the worst case over the shell can be pinned at `‖h‖ = b` by
single crossing rather than by stochastic ordering alone.

TODO (previous batch).  Obstruction (b) has shrunk.  The tail monotonicity
`noncentralChiSquared_tail_mono` is now CLOSED axiom-clean (as is the
`stdGaussian_normSq_le_antitone` it rests on, via unequal-weight Prékopa–Leindler), so the
old "still-open" qualifier is obsolete.  Moreover the shell here is BOUNDED (`b ≤ ‖h‖ ≤ B`)
and, unlike the multinomial shell of `ChiSquaredMaximin`, does not move with `n`; once the
per-`h` local limit is available (obstruction (a)), the `limsup ≤` half follows by
evaluating at a fixed `h` with `‖h‖ = b`, and the `liminf ≥` half needs only a
uniform-over-a-COMPACT-shell version of that limit — an equicontinuity statement, strictly
easier than the unbounded/moving-shell version needed in `ChiSquaredMaximin`.  Obstruction
(a), the exponential-family LAN expansion of `smoothModel` at `θ = 0`
(`PointEstimation.ExponentialFamily.Smoothness`, not imported here), remains the real
blocker and is what keeps this a single named debt.

TODO (RE-DERIVED, wave 5; obstruction (a) is now DISCHARGED, (b) is what is left).  The
exponential-family expansion is no longer a debt of this file and no longer needs the
`Smoothness` import: `logPartition_quadratic_bound` above proves
`|A(θ) − ‖θ‖²/2| ≤ C‖θ‖³` on any ball, from scratch and axiom-clean, by an elementary
third-order Taylor bound on `e^z` plus the moment identities supplied by `hcentred`/`hortho`
(the sign-vector envelope `integrable_exp_l1` makes every exponential moment finite, and
`hlaw` at `n = 1` already forces every tilt to be integrable, so `hint` is not even
required).  Together with `hEdens`-style tilt-to-`withDensity` rewriting and
`pi_scoreLaw_weakConverges`, that is exactly the local-limit input asked for here: the
per-`h` local law of `Sₙ` is `χ²_k(‖h‖²)`, since under `Q n h` the sample is i.i.d.
`p_{h/√n}` and the score vector is asymptotically `N(h, Iₖ)`.

WHAT IS LEFT is obstruction (b) alone, in its `liminf ≥` form: the *uniformity over the
compact shell* `b ≤ ‖h‖ ≤ B` of that per-`h` limit.  The `limsup ≤` half is immediate
(evaluate at a fixed `h` with `‖h‖ = b` and use the per-`h` limit plus
`noncentralChiSquared_tail_mono`); the `liminf ≥` half needs the local power
`h ↦ P_{n,h}{Sₙ > c}` to converge *uniformly* on the shell, which per-`h` weak convergence
does not give.  Since the shell is compact and does not move with `n`, an equicontinuity
argument suffices — the missing brick is an equicontinuity/uniform-Berry–Esseen estimate for
the drifting-mean score vector, not any further exponential-family analysis.

TODO (RE-DERIVED, wave 6; the "equicontinuity/uniform-Berry–Esseen" diagnosis above is
SUPERSEDED).  Uniformity over the shell is NOT needed at all.  The shell `{b ≤ ‖h‖ ≤ B}` is
compact, so the `liminf ≥` half follows by choosing near-minimisers `hₙ` (with
`power_n(hₙ) ≤ sInf_n + (n+1)⁻¹`) and passing to a convergent subsequence `hₙ → h₀`, `‖h₀‖ ≥ b`;
all that is then required is the DRIFTING-parameter local limit
`power_n(hₙ) → ncχ²_k(‖h₀‖²)(c,∞)`, followed by `noncentralChiSquared_tail_mono`.  No estimate
uniform in `h` ever enters.

The remaining analytic input is therefore a single named brick: membership of
`fun n => ((smoothModel P₀ ψ hψ).P (n^{-1/2} • hₙ)).map (psiVec ψ)` in
`Bootstrap.Multivariate.meanVecSeqClass` (weak convergence of the tilts to `P₀`, mean vectors
`→ 0`, covariances `→ Iₖ`), together with the FIRST-order expansion of the mean map
    `m(θ) = ∫ psiVec ψ dp_θ = θ + O(‖θ‖²)`,
which is what makes the Slutsky shift `√n · m(hₙ/√n) → h₀` and hence
`Zₙ ⇒ N(h₀, Iₖ)`; `Sₙ = ‖Zₙ‖²` then gives `χ²_k(‖h₀‖²)` by the continuous-mapping bridge
already used in the null case, and the constant-threshold portmanteau converts weak
convergence into convergence of `P{Sₙ > c}`.  The mean expansion is provable *here*, by the
elementary route of `logPartition_quadratic_bound` above (third-order bound
`abs_exp_sub_quadratic_le` on `e^z` plus the sign-vector envelope `integrable_exp_l1`, applied
to the numerator `∫ψⱼ e^{⟪θ,ψ⟫}` and the denominator separately, using `hcentred`/`hortho` for
the zeroth and first moments) — no `ExponentialFamily.Smoothness` import and no Fréchet
derivative.  That brick, plus the subsequence bookkeeping, is the whole remaining debt. -/
