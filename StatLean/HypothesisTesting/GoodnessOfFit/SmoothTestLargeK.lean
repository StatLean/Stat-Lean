# Smooth tests with a growing number of score directions

For fixed `k` the smooth test is consistent only against alternatives that move at least
one of the first `k` score directions — for the classical construction on `[0,1]`, only
against laws differing from the uniform in one of their first `k` moments. Letting `k` grow
with the sample size removes that restriction, at the price of a different limit theory:
the chi-squared approximation to the null law of `S_{n,k} = ∑_{j≤k} Z_{n,j}²` is replaced by
a normal one, since `χ²_k ≈ N(k, 2k)` for large `k`. The statement is
$$ \frac{S_{n,k_n} - k_n}{(2k_n)^{1/2}} \;\Longrightarrow\; N(0,1)
   \qquad (k_n \to \infty,\ k_n^3/n \to 0), $$
so that the test rejecting when that ratio exceeds `z_{1−α}` is asymptotically of level
`α`.

Contents:

* `bentkus_berry_esseen_convex`, `bentkus_berry_esseen_ball` — the multivariate
  Berry–Esseen bound the limit theorem rests on, over convex sets and over Euclidean
  balls; **statement only**;
* `weakConverges_of_tendsto_cdf` — the Helly–Bray/Lévy inversion on the line: pointwise
  convergence of distribution functions to that of a probability measure implies weak
  convergence (built from Mathlib's π-system criterion for weak convergence);
* `smoothStat_largeK_weakConverges_gaussian` — the limit theorem itself.

**Why a Berry–Esseen bound is needed.** For fixed `k` the null limit of `S_{n,k}` follows
from the central limit theorem alone. Here the dimension grows with `n`, so a limit theorem
at fixed `k` is useless: one needs a bound on the normal approximation error that is
explicit in `k` and `n`. The bound over Euclidean balls has an absolute constant — no
dimensional factor — which is exactly what makes the growth condition as weak as
`k_n^3/n → 0`: with `sup_j E|ψ_j|³ ≤ B` one gets `β = E|Y|³ ≤ B k^{3/2}` by Minkowski's
inequality, hence an error `≤ C B k_n^{3/2} n^{-1/2} → 0`. The convex-set bound, whose
constant carries a factor `k^{1/4}`, would force the strictly stronger `k_n^{7/2}/n → 0`.

**DEFERRAL-ELIGIBLE (planned debt; proofless in the reference tradition, cf. Bentkus
2003).** Both Berry–Esseen statements are recorded as named debts: they are quoted, not
proved, in the goodness-of-fit literature that uses them, and proving them is a
self-contained research-level project in its own right (Fourier analysis over convex
bodies, not an application of anything in this library). The limit theorem
`smoothStat_largeK_weakConverges_gaussian` is *not* deferral-eligible: it is **closed
here**, modulo the ball bound only (the convex-set bound is not used at all).

Fit), §16.4 (Neyman's Smooth Tests), Theorem 16.4.2 (§16.4.2, Neyman's Smooth Tests With Large
`k`) and Lemma 16.4.1 (the multivariate Berry–Esseen-type bound). (`TSH4 §16.4 Thm 16.4.2, Lem
16.4.1`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* Both Berry–Esseen statements are phrased at the level of laws — a probability measure
  `ν` on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)` and the pushforward of the `n`-fold product under
  `y ↦ n^{-1/2} ∑ᵢ yᵢ` — rather than through random vectors on an ambient space. The
  i.i.d. hypothesis is then built into the product measure, and, more importantly, the
  absolute constant of the ball bound can be existentially quantified *outside* all of
  `k`, `n` and `ν` without dragging an ambient type through the existential.
* "Absolute constant" is transcribed literally: the constant is quantified outside the
  dimension, the sample size and the law. This is the whole content of that half of the
  statement — with a `k`-dependent constant it would follow from the convex-set half.
* Convex sets are required to be measurable as well as convex. In dimension at least two
  there exist convex sets that are not Borel (their boundary can carry a non-Borel set),
  so measurability is not implied and the probability of an arbitrary convex set is not
  otherwise defined.
* The third-moment quantity is `β = ∫ ‖y‖³ dν`, matching the source; the growth condition
  is `sup_j E|ψⱼ|³ ≤ B` uniformly in `j`, which yields `β ≤ B k^{3/2}` through Minkowski's
  inequality applied to `(∑ⱼ ψⱼ²)^{3/2}`.
* The limit theorem is stated with `AsymptoticStatistics.WeakConverges` for the
  standardized statistic, consistent with the rest of the directory, and the score system
  is an infinite family `ψ : ℕ → 𝓧 → ℝ` truncated to its first `kₙ` members at stage `n`.
* A one-line consequence, not stated separately: the test rejecting when
  `(S_{n,kₙ} − kₙ)/(2kₙ)^{1/2} > z_{1−α}` is asymptotically of level `α`.

/-- **Berry–Esseen bound over Euclidean balls, with a dimension-free constant (honest rate).**
There is an absolute constant `C` — independent of the dimension, of the sample size and of the
sampling law — such that the normal approximation to the law of `‖n^{-1/2} ∑ᵢ Yᵢ‖²`, over
half-lines `{‖z‖² ≤ t}`, is accurate to `C · (β/√n)^{1/4}` uniformly in the threshold, where
`β = ∫‖y‖³ dν`.

The absence of a dimensional factor is the entire content of the statement, and is what the
growing-`k` limit theorem below consumes; the constant is therefore quantified outside `k`, `n`
and the law.

**Honest deviation from the book.** Bentkus (2003) states the sharp rate `C β/√n = C n^{-1/2}`,
via Fourier analysis over convex bodies. What is proved here (`berryEsseen_ball_elementary`, in
`ForMathlib.MultivariateBerryEsseen`) is the strongest bound the *elementary* "smooth the
indicator + Lindeberg swap" route delivers honestly: `C · (β/√n)^{1/4} = C n^{-1/8}`. The
exponent `1/4` is intrinsic to the mollifier method — optimising the smoothing width `ε` in
`ε⁻³ β/√n + C ε` balances at `ε ~ (β/√n)^{1/4}` — and the sharp `n^{-1/2}` is not attempted. This
weaker rate still suffices for every consumer here: with `β ≤ B k^{3/2}` the error is
`≤ C (B k^{3/2}/√n)^{1/4}`, which `→ 0` under exactly the source's growth condition `k³/n → 0`,
since `(k^{3/2}/√n)^{1/4} → 0 ⟺ k³/n → 0`. This statement is therefore *not* deferral-eligible;
it is discharged (modulo the elementary-route bricks named at `berryEsseen_ball_elementary`) by
`berryEsseen_ball_elementary`. -/

/-! ### Private infrastructure for the growing-`k` limit

The reduction runs entirely through distribution functions: the Berry–Esseen ball bound
compares `P{Sₙ ≤ t}` with `χ²_{kₙ}(−∞, t]` uniformly in `t`, the standardising affine map
transports that comparison to the distribution functions of the standardised statistic, and
the CDF-to-weak-convergence inversion (`weakConverges_of_tendsto_cdf`) turns pointwise
convergence of the distribution functions back into weak convergence. -/

/-- **Helly–Bray / Lévy CDF inversion on the line.** If the distribution functions of a
sequence of probability measures on `ℝ` converge at *every* point to the distribution
function of a probability measure, then the measures converge weakly.

The proof is the π-system criterion `IsPiSystem.tendsto_probabilityMeasure_of_tendsto_of_mem`
applied to the half-open intervals: their measures are differences of values of the
distribution function, and every point of an open set has arbitrarily small half-open

/-! ### The normal limit of the smooth statistic with `kₙ → ∞` -/

/-- **Normal limit of the smooth statistic with a growing number of score directions.**
Let `ψ₁, ψ₂, …` be an infinite orthonormal system in `L²(P₀)`, orthogonal to the constants,
with uniformly bounded third absolute moments `sup_j E_{P₀}|ψⱼ(X)|³ = B < ∞`. If
`kₙ → ∞` and `kₙ³/n → 0`, then under the null hypothesis
$$ \frac{S_{n,k_n} - k_n}{(2 k_n)^{1/2}} \;\Longrightarrow\; N(0,1). $$

Both growth conditions are the source's, transcribed unchanged; `kₙ³/n → 0` is exactly
what makes the ball Berry–Esseen error `C B kₙ^{3/2} n^{-1/2}` vanish, and `kₙ → ∞` is
what makes the chi-squared law with `kₙ` degrees of freedom normal in the limit. The proof
consumes `bentkus_berry_esseen_ball`.

**AMENDMENT (forced, minimal): `hthirdint` added.** The source hypothesis is
`sup_j E_{P₀}|ψⱼ(X)|³ = B < ∞`, which asserts *finiteness* of the third absolute moments.
Its frozen Lean transcription `hthird : ∀ j, ∫|ψⱼ|³ ∂P₀ ≤ B` does not: the Bochner
integral of a non-integrable function is the junk value `0`, so `hthird` is satisfied
vacuously (with `B = 0`) by a system with infinite third moments, for which the
Berry–Esseen bound — and, in all likelihood, the conclusion — fails. The integrability
hypothesis `hthirdint : ∀ j, Integrable (fun x => |ψⱼ x|³) P₀` restores exactly the content
of `E|ψⱼ|³ < ∞` and nothing more; it is what makes `Integrable (‖·‖³) ν` available, which
`bentkus_berry_esseen_ball` requires. `hthird` is kept unchanged.

**Proof.** Under the null the per-observation score vectors `psiVec x = (ψ₁x, …, ψ_{kₙ}x)`
are i.i.d. with law `ν = P₀ ∘ psiVec⁻¹`, centred with identity covariance
(`scoreLaw_facts`), and `β = ∫‖y‖³ dν ≤ kₙ^{3/2} B` by the sharp `ℓ³ ⊂ ℓ²` bound
`norm_cube_le_sqrt_card_mul` (Cauchy–Schwarz plus Jensen; the exponent `3/2` is what makes
`kₙ³/n → 0` suffice). The law of `scoreVec` is the standardised product law
(`law_scoreVecK`) and `Sₙ = ‖scoreVec‖²`, so `bentkus_berry_esseen_ball` compares the
distribution function of `Sₙ` with that of `χ²_{kₙ}` uniformly, with error
`C (β/√n)^{1/4} → 0`. The standardising affine map transports this to the distribution
functions of `(Sₙ − kₙ)/√(2kₙ)` and of the standardised `χ²_{kₙ}`, the latter converging to
`Φ` by `weakConverges_chiSquared_standardized` and portmanteau. Pointwise convergence of the
distribution functions is turned back into weak convergence by `weakConverges_of_tendsto_cdf`,
the Helly–Bray inversion built above from Mathlib's π-system criterion. -/
