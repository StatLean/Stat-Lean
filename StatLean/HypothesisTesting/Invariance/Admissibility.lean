# Admissibility of convex acceptance regions in an exponential family

Optimality within a restricted class — invariant tests, say — does not by itself make a
test admissible: a uniformly most powerful invariant test can be beaten uniformly by a
test that is not invariant. Admissibility therefore has to be established separately, and
the classical route for exponential families is *convexity of the acceptance region*.

Two notions are distinguished. A test `φ₀` is **`α`-admissible** against a class of
alternatives when no level-`α` competitor has power at least as large everywhere on that
class without matching it there. It is **d-admissible** when the two-sided comparison —
power at least as large on the alternatives *and* at most as large on the null — forces
equality of the power functions throughout. The second is the decision-theoretic notion;
neither implies the other in general.

The main theorem says: for an exponential family on the natural-statistic scale, if the
acceptance region `A₀` is **closed and convex**, and if every open half-space missing `A₀`
points in a direction along which the alternative class contains an unbounded ray, then
any competing acceptance region that is uniformly no worse than `A₀` on the alternatives
is contained in `A₀` up to a null set. The mechanism is geometric: a competitor
protruding from a closed convex set can be separated from it by a hyperplane, and pushing
the natural parameter to infinity along the direction of that hyperplane makes the
protruding part dominate the likelihood, so the competitor would have to be *strictly*
worse somewhere on the alternatives. Admissibility of `φ₀` follows; if in addition the
size `α` is attained at a point of the closure of the null class, the sharper
`α`-admissibility follows too.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and J.P. Romano, *Testing Statistical Hypotheses*, 4th ed.,
Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2022 (ISBN 978-3-030-70577-0), Chapter 6 (Invariance), §6.7
(Admissibility), Theorem 6.7.1 (in an exponential family a test with closed convex acceptance
region is d-admissible) and Corollary 6.7.1 (α-admissibility). (`TSH4 §6.7 Thm 6.7.1, Cor
6.7.1`.)

**Main results.**
* `IsDAdmissible`, `IsAlphaAdmissible` — the two admissibility notions;
* `statScaleFamily`, `statScaleBase` — the induced family and dominating measure on the
  natural-statistic scale;
* `acceptance_subset_of_power_le` — closed convex acceptance region: any uniformly
  no-worse competitor is a.e. contained in it;
* `isDAdmissible_of_convex_acceptance`, `isAlphaAdmissible_of_size_attained` — the two
  admissibility conclusions.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* Everything is stated **on the natural-statistic scale**: acceptance regions are subsets
  of `V = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin s)`, the model is the family of laws of the natural
  statistic (`statScaleFamily`), and the null set in the conclusion is measured by the
  image of the reference measure (`statScaleBase`). The source identifies the sample space
  with the statistic scale for this theorem; the sample-space reading is the pullback of
  the statement along the natural statistic.
* The ray condition is transcribed verbatim: *whenever* the open half-space
  `{t : ⟨a, t⟩ > c}` misses `A₀`, there is a point of the alternative class and a sequence
  of scalars tending to infinity keeping `θ* + λₙ a` in the alternative class.
* `IsDAdmissible` quantifies over **all** critical functions, with no level restriction —
  the level enters only in `IsAlphaAdmissible`. This matches the source's two definitions.
* `φ₀` is the **nonrandomized** indicator of the complement of `A₀`. The source notes that
  competitors may be randomized but that nonrandomization of `φ₀` is essential, which is
  why the acceptance region — not merely a critical function — is the primitive here.
* In the `α`-admissibility corollary, `θ₀` is required to lie in the natural parameter set
  as well as in the closure of the null class: this is the content of the source's
  "finite point", i.e. an actual parameter rather than a limit at infinity. Continuity of
  the power function in the natural parameter, used to pass from `θ₀` back into the null
  class, is a property of exponential families and is therefore *not* a hypothesis: it is
  a derivation obligation inside the proof.
* The separation step is the geometric Hahn–Banach theorem for a closed convex set and an
  exterior point (`geometric_hahn_banach_closed_point` in Mathlib's
  `Analysis.LocallyConvex.Separation`).

**Bibliographic comments.** Admissibility of tests with convex acceptance regions in
exponential families, and the ray condition delimiting the alternative classes against
which admissibility holds, come from the work of C. Stein ("The admissibility of Hotelling's
$T^2$-test," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **27** (1956), 616–623) and A. Birnbaum
("Characterizations of complete classes of tests of some multiparametric hypotheses, with
applications to likelihood ratio tests," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **26** (1955), 21–36); the
complete-class theory for such problems was extended by K. Matthes and D. R. Truax
("Tests of composite hypotheses for the multivariate exponential family," *Ann. Math.
Statist.* **38** (1967), 681–697). Admissibility of the one- and two-sided $t$-tests
against all invariant classes of alternatives is due to E. L. Lehmann and C. Stein
(1953), building on their earlier work on non-parametric hypotheses (*Ann. Math. Statist.*
**20** (1949), 28–45).
