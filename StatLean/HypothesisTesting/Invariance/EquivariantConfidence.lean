# Equivariant confidence sets and uniformly most accurate equivariance

The duality between tests and confidence sets — `θ ∈ S(x)` exactly when `x ∈ A(θ)` — is
independent of what the parameter is: real, vector-valued, or a label for an unknown
distribution. This file carries the invariance reduction across that duality.

A group acting on the data induces an action on the parameter space and hence on *sets* of
parameters, `g^*S = {ḡθ : θ ∈ S}`. A confidence family is **equivariant** when
`g^*S(x) = S(g·x)`: re-expressing the data in transformed coordinates transforms the
confidence statement in the matching way, so the statement does not depend on the
coordinate system. (The older name "invariant" is misleading — the sets do move.)

The dictionary is exact. A confidence family is equivariant precisely when its dual
acceptance-region family is equivariant, `A(ḡθ) = g·A(θ)`. Specializing to group elements
that *fix* `θ` — the transformations under which the hypothesis `θ' = θ` is itself
invariant — an equivariant confidence family has acceptance regions invariant under each
stabilizer. The optimality transfer follows: if for every `θ` the acceptance region is the
UMP invariant test of `θ' = θ` at level `α`, then every competing equivariant confidence
family at level `1 − α` yields invariant tests that are no more powerful, hence covers
every false parameter value at least as often. The original family is therefore uniformly
most accurate among equivariant families.

Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2022 (ISBN 978-3-030-70577-0), Chapter 6 (Invariance), §6.11
(Equivariant Confidence Sets), Lemma 6.11.1 (equivariant confidence sets correspond to
invariant acceptance regions). (`TSH4 §6.11 Lem 6.11.1`.)

**Main results.**
* `IsEquivariantConfidence`, `IsUMAEquivariant` — equivariance and uniform accuracy;
* `isEquivariantConfidence_iff_acceptance_equivariant` — the dictionary, both directions;
* `acceptance_invariant_of_equivariantConfidence` — equivariant confidence sets have
  stabilizer-invariant acceptance regions;
* `isUMAEquivariant_of_isUMPInvariant` — UMP invariant acceptance regions give uniformly
  most accurate equivariant confidence sets.

**Dependency note.** `confidenceSet`, `IsConfidenceFamily`, `acceptanceTest` and the two
bridge lemmas `isCriticalFn_acceptanceTest` / `power_acceptanceTest` come from the sibling
`Tests/Confidence.lean` (work item `ht/test-foundations`), which carries the
test–confidence-set duality and is itself `sorry`-free; the optimality transfer below is
proved through those bridges.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The induced action on parameter sets is the image `(g • ·) '' S`, so equivariance reads
  `(g • ·) '' S x = S (g • x)`.
* The source's group `G_θ` is *any* group of transformations leaving the hypothesis
  `θ' = θ` invariant; the only property its proof uses is `ḡθ = θ`. The statements below
  are therefore given for the **stabilizer** of `θ`, which is the largest such group — so
  they specialize to every `G_θ` the source allows.
* Part (i) of the source's lemma follows from the dictionary; the dictionary itself is the
  honest two-directional statement, since stabilizer-invariance of the acceptance regions
  alone is *not* enough to recover equivariance of the confidence family (full
  equivariance `A(ḡθ) = g·A(θ)` is).
* Acceptance regions enter the optimality statement through the nonrandomized test
  rejecting off `A θ`, i.e. the indicator of `(A θ)ᶜ`.
* Uniform accuracy is stated as the source defines it: minimizing the probability of
  covering each *false* value `θ' ≠ θ`.
* **Definition amendment (documented deviation).** `IsUMAEquivariant` quantifies its
  competitors over families with **measurable slices**, matching `IsUMAConfidence` in
  `Tests/Confidence.lean`. Without it the optimality transfer is not even expressible: the
  argument inverts the competitor `S'` into the test `1_{Bᶜ}` with `B = {x | θ' ∈ S' x}`,
  which must be a critical function, and `P θ B` on the right-hand side of the conclusion
  is not a probability unless `B` is measurable. This is the standing convention of the
  sibling file, not a weakening special to this one.

**Bibliographic comments.** The duality between families of tests and confidence sets is
due to J. Neyman ("Outline of a theory of statistical estimation based on the classical
theory of probability," *Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A* **236** (1937), 333–380). Equivariance of
confidence sets and the transfer of invariance optimality across the duality belong to the
invariance program of G. A. Hunt and C. Stein ("Most stringent tests of statistical
hypotheses," unpublished manuscript, 1946) and C. Stein ("Some problems in multivariate
analysis, Part I," Technical Report 6, Department of Statistics, Stanford University,
1956), as developed in E. L. Lehmann's lecture tradition of the 1950s; the relation
between invariance and sufficiency in this setting is treated by W. J. Hall,
R. A. Wijsman and J. K. Ghosh ("The relationship between sufficiency and invariance with
applications in sequential analysis," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **36** (1965), 575–614).

Competitors are quantified with **measurable slices** `{x | θ ∈ S' x}`, exactly as in
`IsUMAConfidence` in `Tests/Confidence.lean`. This is a Lean-side necessity, not a
weakening of the classical statement: the argument inverts the competitor into a genuine
test, and a critical function must be measurable — and the coverage of a family with
non-measurable slices is not a probability statement in the first place. -/
