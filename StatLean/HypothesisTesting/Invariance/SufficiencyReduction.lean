# Invariance after sufficiency: almost invariance, power invariance, and legitimacy

Restricting attention to invariant tests is a departure from comparing tests purely by
their power functions, so it is natural to ask what invariance means *at the level of
power functions*. One implication is immediate: an invariant — indeed an almost invariant
— test has a power function invariant under the induced group. The converse fails in
general, but it holds once the problem has first been reduced to a **sufficient statistic
whose family of laws is boundedly complete**. That is the content of the first result
below, and it is what makes almost invariance the right class to work with.

Two consequences follow. First, a test that is UMP among almost invariant tests based on
the sufficient statistic is optimal in a much larger class: among *all* tests of the
original data whose power function depends on the parameter only through a maximal
invariant. Second — and this is the practical point — reducing by sufficiency **before**
applying invariance is legitimate: every invariant test of the raw data is matched, in
power, by an almost invariant (and, under the structural conditions for almost invariance,
by a genuinely invariant) test of the statistic, so nothing is lost by performing the two
reductions in that order.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and J.P. Romano, *Testing Statistical Hypotheses*, 4th ed.,
Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2022 (ISBN 978-3-030-70577-0), Chapter 6 (Invariance), §6.5
(Almost Invariance), Lemma 6.5.1 (for a boundedly complete sufficient statistic, invariance of
the power function is equivalent to almost invariance), Theorem 6.5.2 and Theorem 6.5.3
(legitimacy of reducing by sufficiency before invariance). (`TSH4 §6.5 Lem 6.5.1, Thm 6.5.2,
Thm 6.5.3`.)

**Main results.**
* `power_invariant_iff_almostInvariant` — for a boundedly complete family of laws of the
  statistic, invariance of the power function ⟺ almost invariance of the test;
* `isUMP_of_isUMPAlmostInvariant_sufficient` — a UMP almost invariant test based on a
  sufficient statistic is UMP among all tests with power depending only on a maximal
  invariant of the parameter;
* `exists_almostInvariant_on_stat_of_invariant`,
  `exists_invariant_on_stat_of_invariant`,
  `isUMPInvariant_comp_of_isUMPInvariant_stat` — the three parts of the legitimacy of the
  sufficiency-then-invariance reduction.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* In the first result the group acts on the **statistic space** `𝓣`, and the relevant
  family is the family of laws `statLaw P T`. Bounded completeness is the point-estimation
  predicate `IsBoundedlyCompleteStat`, applied to that family; the invariance of the
  reduced problem is `IsInvariantModel` for `statLaw P T`. Sufficiency is *not* assumed
  here — the source's lemma needs only bounded completeness of the family of laws.
* Almost invariance of a test of the statistic is taken "a.e. `P^T`", i.e. with respect to
  every member `statLaw P T θ`, matching the source's exceptional-set convention.
* The induced group on the statistic space is supplied as a `MulAction G 𝓣` instance
  together with the intertwining law `T (g·x) = g·(T x)` (`hTcompat`). This is a
  **LEAN-ONLY** packaging of the source's setup, which imposes the compatibility condition
  `T x₁ = T x₂ ⟹ T(g x₁) = T(g x₂)` and *then defines* the induced transformation by
  `g̃ (T x) = T (g x)`; supplying the action as data plus the intertwining identity is the
  same content once the induced group exists, which is exactly what the condition asserts.
* Maximal invariance of the parameter-space map `v` is written inline as the two set-level
  conditions, so no measurable structure is demanded of the parameter space.

**Bibliographic comments.** The interplay of sufficiency and invariance — in particular the
legitimacy of reducing by sufficiency first — was settled in the invariance program of
G. A. Hunt and C. Stein ("Most stringent tests of statistical hypotheses," unpublished
manuscript, 1946) and C. Stein ("Some problems in multivariate analysis, Part I,"
Technical Report 6, Department of Statistics, Stanford University, 1956), and developed in
E. L. Lehmann's lecture tradition of the 1950s. A definitive treatment of when the two
reductions commute is due to W. J. Hall, R. A. Wijsman and J. K. Ghosh ("The relationship
between sufficiency and invariance with applications in sequential analysis," *Ann. Math.
Statist.* **36** (1965), 575–614). Bounded completeness as the hypothesis converting
power-function invariance into almost invariance of the test traces to E. L. Lehmann and
H. Scheffé ("Completeness, similar regions, and unbiased estimation," *Sankhyā* **10**
(1950), 305–340).
