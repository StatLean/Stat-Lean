# The sign-change identity for symmetric tests of symmetry

Tests of the hypothesis that a distribution is symmetric about the origin are usually
built from the ranks of the absolute observations together with the signs. Such tests are
calibrated under the assumption that the observations are an i.i.d. sample from a
continuous distribution symmetric about the origin. That assumption is often the doubtful
part of the model — the observations may be gathered under different experimental
conditions and need be neither identically distributed nor even independent.

The identity below shows that for tests **symmetric in their arguments** the calibration
survives this loss of assumptions entirely. If a symmetric critical function has mean `α`
under every independent sample from continuous distributions symmetric about the origin, then
it has mean `α` under *any* joint distribution invariant under the `2^N` coordinatewise
sign changes — no independence, no common distribution. In the paired-comparison design
this invariance is guaranteed by construction, since the treatment is assigned at random
within each pair; so the stated significance level is exactly right regardless of how the
pairs differ from one another.

The mechanism is that the null-calibration forces the *average over the `2^N` sign
patterns* of the test to equal `α` almost everywhere, and sign-change invariance of the joint
law makes the conditional distribution of the signs given the absolute values uniform over
those `2^N` patterns — so the pointwise average is exactly the conditional expectation.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and J.P. Romano, *Testing Statistical Hypotheses*, 4th ed.,
Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2022 (ISBN 978-3-030-70577-0), Chapter 6 (Invariance), §6.10
(The Hypothesis of Symmetry), Lemma 6.10.1 (the sign-change identity for testing symmetry).
(`TSH4 §6.10 Lem 6.10.1`.)

## The transcribed identity is FALSE, and the repair carried out here

`not_integral_eq_of_sign_invariant` refutes the identity as printed, with `N = 1`, `α = 0`,
`φ = 1_{\{0\}}` and `Q = δ₀`; a second counterexample in its docstring has no zeros and no
ties. The calibration hypothesis pins the sign-average to `α` only off a set null for every
*non-atomic* law, and a sign-change invariant `Q` may sit entirely on that set.

Two **documented amendments** are therefore made to the printed statement, and the amended
statement `integral_eq_of_sign_invariant` is proved in full.

1. `Q ≪ volume` (absolute continuity of the joint law with respect to Lebesgue measure on
   `ℝ^N`). This amendment is *forced*: the counterexamples are atomic laws, and for `N = 1`
   they survive amendment 2 as well (see below), so no weakening of the calibration class can
   remove the need for it. It is the first of the two repairs the source's own argument
   silently uses.
2. The calibration class is the **independent, not necessarily identically distributed**
   one: `φ` is assumed to have mean `α` under `⊗ᵢ Dᵢ` for every family of continuous
   distributions symmetric about the origin, rather than only under the i.i.d. products
   `D^{⊗N}`. This amendment is *not* forced — the i.i.d. form is presumably still true — but
   it is what the proof below uses, and dropping it is a genuine gap: passing from "mean `α`
   under every i.i.d. continuous symmetric sample" to the pointwise sign-average identity is a
   completeness statement for the class of order statistics from non-atomic laws, whose
   standard proof is an inclusion–exclusion (equivalently, a polynomial-coefficient extraction)
   over the `N^N` terms of `(∑ᵢ wᵢUᵢ)^{⊗N}` and is not formalized here. With independent
   marginals the same conclusion is one application of the product structure, which is what is
   done below.

With amendment 2 the permutation-symmetry hypothesis of the printed statement is not needed and
is dropped; the identity holds for every critical function. For `N = 1` the two calibration
classes coincide, so the counterexample of `not_integral_eq_of_sign_invariant` refutes the
amended statement as well once `Q ≪ volume` is dropped: both amendments are visible in that one
example.

**Main results.**
* `signFlip` — the coordinatewise sign-change transformation;
* `measurable_signFlip` — its measurability;
* `signAverage` — the average of a test over the `2^N` sign patterns;
* `not_integral_eq_of_sign_invariant` — the counterexample refuting the printed identity;
* `integral_eq_of_sign_invariant` — the amended identity.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The `2^N` sign changes are indexed by `Fin N → Bool` and applied through `signFlip`.
  They are *not* packaged as a group action: the statement quantifies over the family of
  transformations directly, which is all the argument uses and avoids importing a group
  structure on the index type.
* The null class is transcribed with `Measure.pi D` for an arbitrary family `D` of
  distributions which are **continuous** (no atoms, `Dᵢ {t} = 0`) and **symmetric about the
  origin** (`Dᵢ` invariant under negation); see amendment 2 above.
* The engine is `pi_symmetrize_eq`: the product of the *symmetrizations* of measures `νᵢ` is
  the uniform average of the `2^N` sign-flips of `⊗ᵢνᵢ`. Hence integrating `φ` against a
  product of symmetric laws is integrating `signAverage φ` against an arbitrary product law.
  Taking `νᵢ` to be normalized Lebesgue measure on a box turns the calibration hypothesis into
  "the average of `signAverage φ` over every box is `α`", and `Measure.pi_eq` upgrades that to
  an identity of measures on each cube `[-R,R]^N`, hence to `signAverage φ = α` a.e.

**Bibliographic comments.** Randomization within matched pairs as the source of exact
significance levels for sign and signed-rank procedures goes back to R. A. Fisher (*The
Design of Experiments*, Oliver & Boyd, 1935). The observation that a symmetric rank test
retains its level under any sign-change-invariant joint law — dispensing with both
independence and identical distribution — belongs to the non-parametric program of
E. L. Lehmann and C. Stein ("On the theory of some non-parametric hypotheses," *Ann. Math.
Statist.* **20** (1949), 28–45), and was developed further in E. L. Lehmann's work of the
1950s. The one-sample signed-rank statistic itself is due to F. Wilcoxon ("Individual
comparisons by ranking methods," *Biometrics Bull.* **1** (1945), 80–83).

/-- **Refutation of the sign-change identity as transcribed.** The identity below is *not*
a theorem for an arbitrary permutation-symmetric critical function and an arbitrary
sign-change-invariant law.

Counterexample: `N = 1`, `α = 0`, `φ = 1_{\{0\}}`, `Q = δ₀`. Then `φ` is a critical function,
it is (vacuously) symmetric in its single argument, every i.i.d. sample from a continuous
symmetric `D` gives it mean `D{0} = 0 = α`, and `δ₀` is invariant under both coordinatewise
sign changes because `-0 = 0`; but `∫ φ dQ = φ 0 = 1 ≠ 0 = α`.

The failure is not confined to the degenerate point `0`. Taking `α = 1/2`,
`φ = 1/2 + (1/2)·1_{\{t₀, -t₀\}}` and `Q = ½ δ_{t₀} + ½ δ_{-t₀}` with `t₀ > 0` gives a
counterexample with no zeros and no ties, so adding "`Q` charges no zeros and no ties" does
not repair it. What the calibration hypothesis really delivers is that the sign-average
equals `α` off a set null for every *non-atomic* law; a sign-change-invariant `Q` may live
on that set.

Since `N = 1`, the i.i.d. calibration class used here coincides with the larger
independent-non-identically-distributed class of the amended `integral_eq_of_sign_invariant`
below: the counterexample refutes that form too, absent the amendment `Q ≪ volume`. -/

/-- **A test calibrated on continuous symmetric distributions keeps its level under any
sign-change-invariant law absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure.**

This is the printed Lemma 6.10.1 with the two documented amendments described in the module
header: the joint law `Q` is assumed absolutely continuous (this is *forced*: see
`not_integral_eq_of_sign_invariant` for the atomic counterexamples), and the calibration
hypothesis is imposed over independent — not necessarily identically distributed — continuous
symmetric samples. Under amendment 2 the permutation-symmetry hypothesis of the printed
statement is not needed.

If a critical function has mean `α` under every independent sample from continuous
distributions symmetric about the origin, then it has mean `α` under every absolutely
continuous joint law invariant under the `2^N` coordinatewise sign changes — in particular
without assuming the coordinates independent or identically distributed. -/
