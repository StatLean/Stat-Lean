# UMP invariant tests under a finite group with transitive induced action

When a testing problem is invariant under a **finite** group `G` and the induced group on
the parameter space acts **transitively** on the null class and on the alternative class
separately, the invariance reduction collapses a composite-vs-composite problem to a
simple-vs-simple one. The reason is that an invariant test has the same power at every
parameter of an induced orbit, so maximizing power against one alternative maximizes it
against all of them; the Neyman–Pearson lemma applied to the pair of **orbit-averaged**
densities then produces a uniformly most powerful invariant test.

Concretely, with the model dominated by a σ-finite measure and densities `p θ`, the test
rejects for large values of
$$ \frac{|G|^{-1}\sum_{g \in G} p_{\bar g\theta_1}(x)}
        {|G|^{-1}\sum_{g \in G} p_{\bar g\theta_0}(x)} , $$
where `θ₀` and `θ₁` are *any* members of the null and alternative classes — the ratio does
not depend on which representatives are chosen.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and J.P. Romano, *Testing Statistical Hypotheses*, 4th ed.,
Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2022 (ISBN 978-3-030-70577-0), Chapter 6 (Invariance), §6.3
(Uniformly Most Powerful Invariant Tests), Theorem 6.3.1 (for a finite group with transitive
induced action the orbit-averaged likelihood ratio gives the UMP invariant test) and Theorem
6.3.2 (the law of an invariant statistic depends only on the maximal invariant). (`TSH4 §6.3
Thm 6.3.1, Thm 6.3.2`.)

**Main results.**
* `isInvariantTest_orbitAverage` — the orbit average of any function is invariant;
* `orbitAverage_eq_avg_translated_density` — the orbit average of a density agrees a.e.
  with the average of the densities at the translated parameters, i.e. with the numerator
  and denominator of the displayed ratio, whenever the dominating measure is invariant;
* `isUMPInvariant_of_orbitAverage_ratio` — a Neyman–Pearson test for the orbit-averaged
  densities is UMP invariant at its size;
* `exists_isUMPInvariant_of_finite_transitive` — the existence statement.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The book states the rejection region through the *parameter-side* average
  `∑ᵢ p_{ḡᵢθ}(x)/N`. The definitional device available here is `orbitAverage`, the
  *sample-side* average `|G|⁻¹ ∑_g p_θ(g·x)`. The two agree a.e. once the dominating
  measure is `G`-invariant (model invariance then reads `p_{ḡθ}(x) = p_θ(g⁻¹·x)` a.e.);
  `orbitAverage_eq_avg_translated_density` records exactly that bridge, so the headline
  theorem is stated on the sample side without any loss of faithfulness.
* Stability of the null and alternative classes under the induced action (`hΘ₀`, `hΘ₁`) is
  *separate* from transitivity and both are demanded: transitivity relates two points of a
  class, stability says the class is not left.
* Invariance of the candidate test is a hypothesis rather than a conclusion because the
  Neyman–Pearson prescription pins the test only off the boundary `{ratio = k}`, where the
  choice is free. `isInvariantTest_orbitAverage` shows that the ratio itself is always
  invariant, so the hypothesis only constrains that free choice.
* The Neyman–Pearson input is used through the declarations of the fundamental lemma
  planned for the sibling `Tests` layer (work item `ht/test-foundations`); the predicates
  `IsMostPowerful` / `IsLevel` / `power` used here all come from `Tests.Defs`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The reduction of an invariant testing problem with a transitive
induced group to a simple-vs-simple problem, and the resulting orbit-averaged likelihood
ratio, belong to the invariance program of G. A. Hunt and C. Stein ("Most stringent tests
of statistical hypotheses," unpublished manuscript, 1946) and C. Stein ("Some problems in
multivariate analysis, Part I," Technical Report 6, Department of Statistics, Stanford
University, 1956), as developed in E. L. Lehmann's lecture tradition of the 1950s. The
underlying optimality criterion is that of J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson ("On the problem of
the most efficient tests of statistical hypotheses," *Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A* **231**
(1933), 289–337).
