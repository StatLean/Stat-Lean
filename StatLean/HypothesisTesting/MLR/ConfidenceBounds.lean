# Uniformly most accurate one-sided confidence bounds under a monotone likelihood ratio

Inverting the uniformly most powerful one-sided tests of `H(θ₀) : θ ≤ θ₀` turns their
optimality into optimality of a confidence bound: the resulting lower bound `θ̲` covers
every false value `θ₀ < θ` with the smallest possible probability, uniformly. When the
distribution function of the statistic is continuous in each variable separately, the bound
is the solution of
$$ F_\theta\bigl(T(x)\bigr) \;=\; 1 - \alpha , $$
and that solution, when it exists, is unique.

Contents:
* `exists_uma_lowerBound` — existence of a uniformly most accurate lower confidence bound
  at every confidence level `1 - α`, together with its characterization as the root of the
  displayed equation.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and J.P. Romano, *Testing Statistical Hypotheses*, 4th ed.,
Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2022 (ISBN 978-3-030-70577-0), Chapter 3 (Uniformly Most
Powerful Tests), §3.5 (Confidence Bounds), Corollary 3.5.1 (uniformly most accurate one-sided
confidence bounds under a monotone likelihood ratio). (`TSH4 §3.5 Cor 3.5.1`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The optimality predicates `IsConfidenceFamily` and `IsUMAConfidence` come from the
  test/confidence-set duality development; this file consumes them and adds nothing to the
  data model. A lower bound `θ̲` is presented as the confidence family `x ↦ [θ̲(x), ∞)`,
  and the false-value set attached to `θ₀` is `(θ₀, ∞)`: the statement "`θ̲(X) ≤ θ₀`" is
  wrong exactly when the true parameter exceeds `θ₀`.
* The single application below reads `IsUMAConfidence P K S (1 - α)`, with `K θ₀` the set
  of parameter values against which the coverage statement `θ₀ ∈ S(x)` is false. Note the
  last argument of that predicate is the *confidence* level, so the significance level `α`
  used everywhere else in this file enters as `1 - α`.
* The distribution function of the statistic is written `(P θ {y | T y ≤ t}).toReal`, and
  the printed hypothesis — continuity in each of `t` and `θ` when the other is held fixed —
  is transcribed as two separate continuity assumptions. Joint continuity is *not*
  assumed, and is not needed. In fact only continuity in `t` is consumed: `hcont_θ` is kept
  because it is a printed hypothesis, but the proof below never uses it (see `hsolvable`).
* The parameter set is the whole real line rather than a general `Ω ⊆ ℝ`; the printed
  statement quantifies over `θ ∈ Ω`, and restricting to a subset would require carrying
  `Ω` through the confidence-set predicates as well.
* **Repair of the printed statement (`hsolvable`).** As printed the theorem is FALSE; the
  counterexample and the minimal repair are recorded on `exists_uma_lowerBound` itself.
* The optimality transfer needs the *most powerful* property of the inverted one-sided test
  against the single null value `θ₀` — a competitor confidence family only controls its
  coverage at `θ₀`. The public one-sided theorems of `MLR/OneSided` state optimality against
  the larger null `(-∞, θ₀]`, whose competitor class is smaller, so the separating-multiplier
  step is redone here (`cb_exists_sep_const`, `cb_hasNPShape`, `cb_isMostPowerful`) in the
  same way as there; the file already carries local copies of several `MLR/OneSided`
  privates for the same reason.

**Bibliographic comments.** Confidence sets, their coverage requirement, and the accuracy
criterion are due to J. Neyman ("Outline of a theory of statistical estimation based on the
classical theory of probability," *Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A* **236** (1937), 333–380);
optimal one-sided bounds for families with monotone likelihood ratio follow from the
optimality theory of S. Karlin and H. Rubin ("The theory of decision procedures for
distributions with monotone likelihood ratio," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **27** (1956),
272–299).

/-! ### Most powerful, against a single null value

The public one-sided theorems of `MLR/OneSided` compare against competitors that are level
`α` on the whole null ray `(-∞, θ₀]`. Inverting a competitor confidence family only produces
a test of level `α` at the single value `θ₀`, so the Karlin–Rubin separation is redone here
for that (larger) competitor class. -/

/-! ### The uniformly most accurate lower bound -/

/-- **Uniformly most accurate lower confidence bounds.** For a family with monotone
likelihood ratio in `T` whose statistic has a distribution function continuous in each
variable separately, there is, at every confidence level `1 - α`, a lower confidence bound
that is uniformly most accurate; and wherever the equation `F_θ(T(x)) = 1 - α` is solvable
its solution is unique and equals the bound.

The confidence family is `x ↦ [θ̲(x), ∞)` and the false values attached to `θ₀` are
`(θ₀, ∞)`.

**Repaired statement.** As printed — i.e. without `hsolvable` — the theorem is FALSE, and
the repair below is the minimal one.

*Counterexample to the printed form.* `𝓧 = ℝ`, `μ = volume`, `T = id`,
`P θ = 𝒩(arctan θ, 1)`, i.e. `p θ x = ϕ(x − arctan θ)`. This is a one-parameter exponential
family in `T = id` read through the strictly increasing `η = arctan`, so `hMLR` holds
(`hasMLR_expFamily`); `F_θ(t) = Φ(t − arctan θ)` is continuous in each variable, giving
`hcont_t`/`hcont_θ`; and `arctan` is injective, giving `hdist`. Fix `α ∈ (0,1)` and put
`z = Φ⁻¹(1 − α)`. The inverted UMP family is `S(x) = {θ : x ≤ arctan θ + z}`, with exact
coverage `P θ {x : x ≤ arctan θ + z} = Φ(z) = 1 − α` and measurable slices
`Iic (arctan θ₀ + z)`, so `S` is a legitimate competitor in the optimality clause. Since
`arctan` has range `(−π/2, π/2)`, `S(x) = ∅` for `x ≥ z + π/2` — a set of positive
`P θ`-probability for every `θ` — which no `Ici (θ̲(x))` can match. Concretely, if
`θ̲ : 𝓧 → ℝ` were measurable and satisfied the conclusion, testing optimality against `S`
at `θ₀ = j`, `θ = j + 1` gives
`P_{j+1} {x : θ̲ x ≤ j} ≤ Φ(arctan j + z − arctan (j+1)) → Φ(z) = 1 − α`, so
`P_{j+1}(B_j) ≥ α − o(1)` for `B_j = {x : θ̲ x > j}`; but `θ̲` is real-valued, so `B_j ↓ ∅`
and `N(B_j) → 0` for `N = 𝒩(π/2, 1)`, while `dTV(P_{j+1}, N) → 0` because
`arctan (j+1) → π/2`, whence `P_{j+1}(B_j) → 0` — contradicting `α > 0`.

*Repair.* Assume the defining equation is solvable, `hsolvable`. This is exactly the
equation displayed in the theorem's own conclusion, so it adds no new notion; it is what
rules out the vacuous (`S(x) = ∅`) and total (`S(x) = ℝ`) confidence sets that a
real-valued lower bound cannot express, and it holds automatically for genuine location
families such as `P θ = 𝒩(θ,1)`. It is not implied by the printed hypotheses: in the
counterexample `F_θ(t) = Φ(t − arctan θ)` never reaches `1 − α` once `t ≥ z + π/2`. -/
