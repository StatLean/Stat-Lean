# Monotone likelihood ratio — core data model

A dominated family with densities `p : Θ → 𝓧 → ℝ` (`Θ` ordered) has **monotone
likelihood ratio (MLR)** in a real statistic `T` when, for `θ < θ'`, the ratio
`p_{θ'}/p_θ` is a nondecreasing function of `T`. We record the division-free (total
positivity of order 2) form:

* `HasMLR p T` — for all `θ < θ'` and all `x, y` with `T x ≤ T y`,
  `p_{θ'}(x)·p_θ(y) ≤ p_θ(x)·p_{θ'}(y)`.

**Reference.** Classical monotone-likelihood-ratio theory; original sources in the
bibliographic comments below.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The TP2 cross-product form avoids division junk entirely (no `0/0` cases) and is
  exactly what the Neyman–Pearson-style arguments consume; the classical "ratio is a
  nondecreasing function of `T`" packaging is derived as a lemma where densities are
  positive.
* Only `Preorder Θ` is required by the definition; the one-sided testing theorems
  assume `LinearOrder Θ`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The MLR condition and the resulting one-sided optimal tests
are due to S. Karlin and H. Rubin ("The theory of decision procedures for distributions
with monotone likelihood ratio," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **27** (1956), 272–299), with
antecedents in the hypergeometric/binomial analyses of J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson;
total positivity is systematized in S. Karlin, *Total Positivity*, Stanford, 1968.
