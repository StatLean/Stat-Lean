# One-sided testing under a monotone likelihood ratio

For a real parameter and a family with monotone likelihood ratio in a statistic `T`, the
one-sided problem `H : θ ≤ θ₀` against `K : θ > θ₀` has a **uniformly** most powerful
solution — the same test works against every alternative — namely
$$ \varphi(x) = 1 \ \text{ if } T(x) > C, \qquad \gamma \ \text{ if } T(x) = C,
\qquad 0 \ \text{ if } T(x) < C, $$
with `C` and `γ` fixed by the exact-size requirement `E_{θ₀}φ = α`. Beyond optimality, the
test's power function is strictly increasing wherever it is not already `0` or `1`, the
test is simultaneously UMP for every shifted null, and it minimizes the rejection
probability below `θ₀`.

Contents:
* `oneSidedTest T C γ` — the test displayed above;
* `isUMP_oneSided` — existence of `(C, γ)` with size exactly `α`, and uniform optimality;
* `power_strictMono_oneSided` — strict monotonicity of the power function;
* `isUMP_oneSided_shifted` — the same test is UMP at every other null boundary `θ'`, at
  the level it happens to have there;
* `power_min_oneSided` — among all tests of size exactly `α` at `θ₀`, it minimizes the
  rejection probability at every `θ < θ₀`;
* `testRisk`, `essentiallyComplete_oneSidedTest` — the family of one-sided tests is an
  essentially complete class for the two-decision problem with monotone losses;
* `hasMLR_expFamily`, `isUMP_oneSided_expFamily` — the one-parameter exponential family
  has monotone likelihood ratio in its natural statistic, hence a UMP one-sided test;
* `integral_mono_of_hasMLR` — a monotone statistic has monotone expectation.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and J.P. Romano, *Testing Statistical Hypotheses*, 4th ed.,
Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2022 (ISBN 978-3-030-70577-0), Chapter 3 (Uniformly Most
Powerful Tests), §3.4 (Distributions with Monotone Likelihood Ratio), Theorem 3.4.1 (existence
of a UMP one-sided test under a monotone likelihood ratio), Corollary 3.4.1 (the one-parameter
exponential-family case) and Theorem 3.4.2 (the one-sided tests form an essentially complete
class). (`TSH4 §3.4 Thm 3.4.1, Cor 3.4.1, Thm 3.4.2`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The frozen `HasMLR` is the division-free cross-product condition; it does **not**
  include the classical requirement that `P_θ ≠ P_{θ'}` for `θ < θ'`. That requirement is
  irrelevant for existence and optimality, but it is exactly what makes the power function
  *strictly* increasing (a constant family satisfies `HasMLR` vacuously and has constant
  power). It is therefore carried as an explicit hypothesis of
  `power_strictMono_oneSided` only, and nowhere else.
* The threshold `C` here is a real number, not an extended one: it is a level of the
  statistic `T`, not a likelihood-ratio threshold. Extended thresholds appear only at the
  likelihood-ratio layer.
* The risk of a test is written directly in terms of its power,
  `R(θ, φ) = β_φ(θ)·L₁(θ) + (1 - β_φ(θ))·L₀(θ)`, which agrees with the integral form
  `∫ p_θ {φ L₁ + (1-φ)L₀} dμ` because `∫ p_θ dμ = 1`.
* The minimal-essential-completeness clause (which additionally assumes that the support
  `{x : p_θ(x) > 0}` does not depend on `θ`) is not stated here; only essential
  completeness is.
* The decreasing-`Q` half of the exponential-family corollary is obtained by applying the
  increasing case to `-T`, and is not stated separately.
* `integral_mono_of_hasMLR` is stated in the one-dimensional form, generalized from
  "nondecreasing in `x`" to "nondecreasing along `T`" (taking `𝓧 = ℝ`, `T = id` recovers
  the printed statement). The `n`-sample clause — a function nondecreasing in each of `n`
  independent coordinates has nondecreasing expectation — is a separate induction and is
  not stated here.

**Bibliographic comments.** Monotone likelihood ratio, the resulting uniformly most
powerful one-sided tests, and the complete-class property of the family they form are due
to S. Karlin and H. Rubin ("The theory of decision procedures for distributions with
monotone likelihood ratio," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **27** (1956), 272–299); the
one-parameter exponential-family case and the underlying optimality argument go back to
J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson ("Contributions to the theory of testing statistical
hypotheses," *Stat. Res. Mem.* **1** (1936), 1–37).

/-- **Minimum rejection probability below the boundary.** Among all tests whose size at
`θ₀` is exactly `α`, the one-sided test minimizes the probability of rejection — the
probability of an error of the first kind — at every `θ < θ₀`.

**Documented deviation from the printed form (forced).** The nondegeneracy hypothesis
`α < 1` is added. Without it the statement is **FALSE**.

*Counterexample.* `𝓧 = ℝ`, `μ = volume`, `T = id`, and the shifted-exponential family
`p θ x = exp(-(x - θ))·1_{x ≥ θ}`, which has monotone likelihood ratio in `T` (the
exponential factors cancel in the cross-product, and `1_{x ≥ θ'}·1_{y ≥ θ} ≤
1_{x ≥ θ}·1_{y ≥ θ'}` whenever `θ < θ'` and `x ≤ y`). Take `C = θ₀ - 1` and `γ = 0`. Then
`p θ₀` vanishes on `{T ≤ C}`, so `α = power P φ θ₀ = 1`. The competitor
`ψ = 1_{x ≥ θ₀}` is a critical function with `power P ψ θ₀ = 1 = α`, yet for every
`θ < θ₀ - 1`, `power P ψ θ = e^{θ-θ₀} < e^{θ-θ₀+1} = power P φ θ`: the one-sided test does
*not* minimize the rejection probability. The mechanism is exactly `α = 1`, and `α < 1` is
the minimal repair: it forces some point at or below `C` to carry positive `θ₀`-density
(`exists_pos_density_below_of_coPower_pos`), which is all the proof needs. The classical
statement obtains the same effect from strictly positive densities. -/

/-- **The one-sided tests form an essentially complete class.** For the two-decision
problem whose losses satisfy `L₁ - L₀ > 0` below the boundary and `< 0` above it, every
test is matched or beaten, uniformly in `θ`, by a one-sided test.

**Documented deviation from the printed form (forced).** The competitor `ψ` is required to
have a nondegenerate size at the boundary, `power P ψ θ₀ ∈ Set.Ioo 0 1`. Without that
restriction the statement is **FALSE**, for the same reason that `isUMP_oneSided` must
exclude `α ∈ {0,1}`: a one-sided test with a *real* critical value cannot match the size of
a degenerate competitor when `T` is unbounded in the relevant tail, and the printed
docstring's own caveat that "`C` here is a real number, not an extended one" is exactly the
gap.

*Counterexample.* `𝓧 = ℝ`, `μ = volume`, `T = id`, `P θ = 𝒩(θ,1)` (an MLR family),
`θ₀ = 0`, `L₀ = 0`, `L₁ θ = -θ` — so `L₁ - L₀ > 0` strictly below `0` and `< 0` strictly
above, as the hypotheses demand. Take `ψ ≡ 1`, a critical function, with
`power P ψ θ = 1` for every `θ`, hence `testRisk P L₀ L₁ ψ θ = -θ`. Every one-sided test
with a real `C` has `power P (oneSidedTest T C γ) θ = 1 - Φ(C - θ) < 1`, so for each
`θ > 0`, `testRisk P L₀ L₁ (oneSidedTest T C γ) θ = (1 - Φ(C-θ))·(-θ) > -θ =
testRisk P L₀ L₁ ψ θ`. No one-sided test dominates `ψ`. Here `power P ψ θ₀ = 1`, which the
amended hypothesis excludes. -/
