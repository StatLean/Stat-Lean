# Two-sided hypotheses in a one-parameter exponential family

Uniformly most powerful tests survive one step beyond the one-sided problem: for
`H : θ ≤ θ₁ or θ ≥ θ₂` against `K : θ₁ < θ < θ₂` in a one-parameter exponential family
there is a UMP test, which rejects on a *bounded* interval of the natural statistic,
$$ \varphi(x) = 1 \ \text{ if } C_1 < T(x) < C_2, \qquad \gamma_i \ \text{ if } T(x) = C_i,
\qquad 0 \ \text{ otherwise}, $$
with the four constants pinned down by the two size conditions
`E_{θ₁}φ = E_{θ₂}φ = α`. Two constraints, hence the generalized fundamental lemma with
`m = 2` rather than the plain one.

Contents:
* `twoSidedTest T C₁ C₂ γ₁ γ₂` — the test displayed above;
* `power_min_twoSided` — outside `[θ₁, θ₂]` the test *minimizes* the rejection
  probability among all tests meeting the two size conditions;
* `isUMP_twoSided` — existence of the four constants and uniform optimality;
* `power_lt_of_twoSided_right` — comparison of two such tests with a common size at `θ₁`:
  shifting the rejection interval to the right raises the power above `θ₁` and lowers it
  below;
* `twoSided_ae_unique` — the two size conditions determine the test almost everywhere.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The rejection region is an interval of the natural statistic, so the test cannot be
  obtained from a single likelihood-ratio comparison; the two size conditions are handled
  by the two-constraint form of the generalized fundamental lemma, whose multipliers
  produce the two boundaries. Only the *sufficiency* halves of that lemma are used
  (`isMax_of_multiplier_form` for the equality-constrained competitor class of
  `power_min_twoSided`, `isMax_le_of_multiplier_form_nonneg` for the inequality-constrained
  class of the UMP clause): the multipliers are written down explicitly by
  `exists_exp_pair_sign` / `exists_exp_pair_sign_opp` rather than produced by a supporting
  hyperplane, so no inner-point hypothesis on the attainable-moment set is needed.
* The identification of the multiplier shape with an interval of the statistic is the
  two-crossing property of `A e^{b₁t} + B e^{b₂t}` against the constant `1`, and it is
  proved without calculus: at a parameter *inside* `(θ₁, θ₂)` the two exponents have
  opposite signs and both interpolation coefficients are positive, so the function is
  strictly convex outright; *outside* `[θ₁, θ₂]` the exponents have the same sign and one
  rescaling by `e^{-b_jt}` turns `1 - S` into a positive combination of two exponentials
  plus a constant, again strictly convex. A strictly convex function with two zeros has a
  forced sign pattern (`sign_of_strictConvexOn_two_zeros`).
* Two of the five statements needed a repair; each is documented on the statement itself,
  with a verified counterexample to the printed form: `power_lt_of_twoSided_right` (`hne`,
  non-degeneracy of the pair of tests) is FALSE as printed, and `isUMP_twoSided` retains a
  single named gap — the simultaneous solution of the two size equations.
* The order of branches in `twoSidedTest` puts the two boundary cases first, so the
  definition is unambiguous even for degenerate constants: at `C₁ = C₂` the value is `γ₁`,
  and for `C₂ ≤ C₁` the test rejects nowhere except possibly at the two boundary points.
  The theorems all produce or assume `C₁ < C₂`.
* The comparison lemma requires the *strict* form of the monotone likelihood ratio
  together with strictly positive densities. Both are transcribed explicitly: the strict
  ratio condition is written division-free as `p_{θ'}(x)·p_θ(y) < p_θ(x)·p_{θ'}(y)` for
  `T x < T y`, matching the frozen non-strict `HasMLR`.
* "`φ*` lies to the right of `φ`" is transcribed as the lexicographic condition on the
  left boundary: either `C₁ < C₁'`, or the boundaries agree and the randomization weight
  there is smaller, `γ₁' < γ₁`.
* Uniqueness is stated as `μ`-a.e. equality. Since the densities are strictly positive,
  this coincides with almost-sure equality under every member of the family.
* The unimodality clause of the classical statement — for `0 < α < 1` the power function
  has an interior maximum and decreases strictly away from it, unless the statistic is
  supported on two points — is not stated here.

/-- **The analytic core of the two-sided uniqueness theorem.** Let `D` be a function of the
statistic `T` whose negative part lies strictly below its positive part along `T` (the
single-sign-change structure produced by `twoSidedVal_sub_sep`), and let `p₁, p₂` be
strictly positive densities whose likelihood ratio is strictly increasing along `T`. If `D`
integrates to zero against both densities, then `D` vanishes `μ`-almost everywhere.

The mechanism: the sign change gives a real `k` separating the ratio `p₂/p₁` across the sign
change, so `D·(p₂ − k·p₁) ≥ 0` pointwise while its integral is `0 − k·0 = 0`; hence
`D = 0` or `p₂ = k·p₁` a.e. Strict monotonicity of the ratio confines `{p₂ = k·p₁}` to a
single level set of `T`, on which `D` is constant, and the vanishing of `∫ D·p₁` kills that
last constant too. -/

/-- **The strict form of the analytic core.** Same single-sign-change structure as
`ae_eq_zero_of_sep`, but the second vanishing integral is replaced by the *nondegeneracy*
hypothesis `¬ D =ᵐ[μ] 0`, and the conclusion is upgraded from `≥ 0` to `> 0`: a difference
whose negative part lies strictly below its positive part along `T`, which integrates to
zero against the lower member and does not vanish almost everywhere, has a strictly positive
integral against the upper member.

The mechanism is the same separating constant `k` for the ratio `p₂/p₁`, giving
`D·(p₂ − k·p₁) ≥ 0` pointwise with integral `∫D p₂ − k·0`. Strictness is where the
nondegeneracy is consumed: were that integral zero, the set `{p₂ = k·p₁}` would have to
carry both a point with `D < 0` and a point with `D > 0`, while strict monotonicity of the
ratio confines it to a single level set of `T` — contradicting the sign change. -/

/-! ### Two exponentials crossing a constant twice

The multiplier shape produced by the generalized fundamental lemma is
`{p_θ > k₁p_{θ₁} + k₂p_{θ₂}}`; in canonical form this is `{S(T) < 1}` for
`S(t) = A e^{b₁t} + B e^{b₂t}`. The three lemmas below identify the shape with an interval
of the statistic when the two exponents have the same sign — the configuration that occurs
for `θ` *outside* `[θ₁, θ₂]`. No calculus is used: after multiplying by the appropriate
`e^{-b_j t}` the function `1 - S` becomes a positive combination of two exponentials plus a
constant, hence strictly convex, and a strictly convex function with two zeros has a forced
sign pattern. -/

/-- **Monotone-rearrangement (Chebyshev-sum) inequality on `[0,1]`.** For a nondecreasing
integrable `g`, the integral over the initial segment `[0, α]` is at most `α` times the
integral over the whole interval, and the integral over the final segment `[α, 1]` is at
least `(1 − α)` times it.

This is brick (c) of the quantile-sweep roadmap recorded at `isUMP_twoSided`: with
`g = r ∘ Q` — the likelihood ratio `dν₂/dν₁` read along the quantile function of `ν₁`, which
is nondecreasing because `η₂ > η₁` — and `∫₀¹ g = 1`, it gives `h(0) ≤ α ≤ h(1 − α)` for the
sliding-window size `h(s) = ∫_s^{s+α} g`, which is what the intermediate value theorem then
consumes.

The proof is the two-sided comparison against the value at the split point: `g ≤ g α` on
`[0, α]` and `g α ≤ g` on `[α, 1]`, so `(1 − α)·∫₀^α g ≤ (1 − α)·α·g α ≤ α·∫_α^1 g`, and
adding `α·∫₀^α g` to both sides gives the first claim. -/

/-- **Strict monotone-rearrangement inequality.** For a nondecreasing integrable `g` on
`[0,1]` which is *not* essentially constant — it separates strictly across some level
`a ∈ (0,1)` — the initial-segment integral is *strictly* below its proportional share:
`∫₀^α g < α ∫₀¹ g` for every `α ∈ (0,1)`.

This is the strict form of brick (c) of the quantile-sweep roadmap at `isUMP_twoSided`, and
it is what places the root of the sweep in the *open* interval `(0, 1−α)`, where the
quantile pair `(Q s, Q (s+α))` is honest (the junk values `Q 0`, `Q 1` are excluded). The
separation hypothesis is supplied there by a level `a = F c` of the null law: below it the
quantile function stays at or under `c`, above it strictly beyond, so the likelihood
ratio — strictly increasing — separates. -/

/-- **Brick (b): the sliding window, weighed by a density, is a level-space integral.**

With the canonical boundary weights of brick (a) — `γ₁·ν{C₁} = F(C₁) − s` and
`γ₂·ν{C₂} = s + α − F(C₂⁻)`, where `C₁ = Q(s)` and `C₂ = Q(s+α)` — the integral of the
two-sided test against any measurable weight `r` is the Lebesgue integral of `r ∘ Q` over the
*level* window `(s, s+α)`:
`∫ φ_s·r dν = ∫_s^{s+α} r(Q u) du`.

Applied with `r = dν₂/dν₁` this says the size of the window test at `θ₂` is the sliding
integral `h(s)` of the roadmap; it is the identity that turns the two-dimensional
root-finding problem of `isUMP_twoSided` into a one-dimensional sweep.

The proof splits the level window at the two atom boundaries `F(C₁) ≤ F(C₂⁻)`. On the two
outer pieces `Q` is *constant* (`quantile_eq_of_leftLim_lt`), which produces the two boundary
terms; the inner piece is evaluated by the half-line change of variables
`setIntegral_Iic_eq_intervalIntegral_quantile` at `C₁` and at `C₂`, minus the atom at `C₂`
(which the level window `(F(C₂⁻), F(C₂)]` carries and the open interval `(C₁,C₂)` does
not). -/

/-- **Comparison of two two-sided tests with a common size at `θ₁`.** If the rejection
interval of the second test lies to the right of that of the first — a larger left
boundary, or the same boundary with a smaller randomization weight there — then the second

holds as `C₁ = -2 < 1 = C₁'`. Both tests are identically `0`: at `t = 0` neither `t = Cᵢ`
nor `Cᵢ < t < Cᵢ₊₁` holds in either configuration. So `hsize` holds (`0 = 0`) while the
conclusion demands `0 < 0` at every `θ > θ₁`. The failure is not an artefact of the constant
statistic: it occurs whenever both rejection intervals miss the essential range of `T`, and
in every such configuration the two tests coincide `μ`-a.e.

*Repair.* Assume the two tests are not `μ`-a.e. equal (`hne`). This is exactly the
negation of the conclusion of the sibling theorem `twoSided_ae_unique`, so it adds no new
notion; since the densities are strictly positive it is equivalent to the two tests
differing on a set of positive `P θ`-probability for one — equivalently every — `θ`. It
cannot be weakened away: whenever the two tests *are* a.e. equal all four powers coincide
and both strict inequalities fail.

*Proof.* The Lehmann comparison in its strict form. `twoSidedVal_sub_sep` says the positive
part of `D = φ' − φ` sits strictly above its negative part along `T`; `hsize` makes
`∫D p_{θ₁} dμ = 0`; and `integral_pos_of_sep` turns strict MLR plus `hne` into
`∫D p_θ dμ > 0` for `θ₁ < θ`. Below `θ₁` the same lemma is applied to `−D` and `−T`, whose
sign change and ratio monotonicity are both reversed. -/
