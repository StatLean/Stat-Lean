# The generalized fundamental lemma: maximization under several side conditions

Given integrable `f₁, …, f_{m+1}` and constants `c₁, …, c_m`, consider the class `𝒞` of
critical functions `φ` obeying the `m` side conditions
$$ \int \varphi f_i \, d\mu \;=\; c_i, \qquad i = 1, \dots, m, $$
and the problem of maximizing `∫ φ f_{m+1} dμ` over `𝒞`. A maximizer exists as soon as
`𝒞` is nonempty; it is characterized — sufficiently always, necessarily at inner points
of the attainable-moment set — by the undetermined-multiplier shape
$$ \varphi(x) = 1 \ \text{ when } f_{m+1}(x) > \textstyle\sum_i k_i f_i(x), \qquad
   \varphi(x) = 0 \ \text{ when } f_{m+1}(x) < \textstyle\sum_i k_i f_i(x). $$

Contents:
* `momentSet μ f` — the attainable-moment set `{(∫φf₁dμ, …, ∫φf_mdμ) : φ critical}`;
* `HasMultiplierShape μ f k φ` — the multiplier shape above, `μ`-a.e.;
* `exists_test_max_integral_of_constraints` — existence of a maximizer over `𝒞`;
* `isMax_of_multiplier_form` — sufficiency of the multiplier shape;
* `isMax_le_of_multiplier_form_nonneg` — with `kᵢ ≥ 0`, maximality also against the
  larger class defined by the *inequality* constraints `∫φfᵢdμ ≤ cᵢ`;
* `convex_isClosed_momentSet`, `exists_multipliers_of_max` — the geometry of the moment
  set, and the existence *and* necessity of the multipliers at an inner point;
* `exists_test_with_prescribed_sizes` — a test of prescribed size `α` against `m`
  distributions whose power against the `(m+1)`-st strictly exceeds `α`;
* `isMax_of_lagrangian` — the abstract Lagrangian sufficiency principle behind all of it.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The classical statement is set on a Euclidean sample space; the only role of that
  assumption is to support the weak compactness theorem for critical functions, which
  holds for a σ-finite dominating measure. We therefore work with a general measurable
  space and `[SigmaFinite μ]`, which is a strict generalization of the printed form.
* The `m` side conditions are indexed by `Fin m` embedded into `Fin (m+1)` via
  `Fin.castSucc`, and the objective is the last coordinate `Fin.last m`. This keeps a
  single function family `f : Fin (m+1) → 𝓧 → ℝ` rather than a pair.
* `HasMultiplierShape` is stated `μ`-a.e. rather than pointwise. This makes the
  sufficiency statements strictly stronger than the printed pointwise form, and makes the
  necessity statement land exactly on the printed conclusion ("(3.30) holds a.e. μ").
* `exists_multipliers_of_max` bundles both halves of the inner-point clause under a
  single `∃ k`: the multipliers exhibited by the supporting hyperplane are the same ones
  that every maximizer is forced to use. Splitting them would silently weaken the result.
* The inner-point hypothesis is transcribed as membership in the ambient `interior` of the
  moment set inside `Fin m → ℝ`. The classical statement is available in two readings:
  ambient interior, or interior relative to the smallest linear space containing the
  moment set. The relative reading is the *weaker hypothesis*, hence the stronger theorem,
  and is the one classically proved. We state only the ambient version here; upgrading to
  the relative-interior hypothesis is a deliberate, documented gap.

**Bibliographic comments.** The extension of the fundamental lemma to several side
conditions is due to J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson ("Contributions to the theory of testing
statistical hypotheses," *Stat. Res. Mem.* **1** (1936), 1–37); its definitive
measure-theoretic form, including the discussion of what happens when the inner-point
condition fails, is due to G. B. Dantzig and A. Wald ("On the fundamental lemma of Neyman
and Pearson," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **22** (1951), 87–93). The use of the resulting
multipliers to construct optimal tests of composite hypotheses is developed in
E. L. Lehmann ("On the existence of least favorable distributions," *Ann. Math. Statist.*
**23** (1952), 408–416).

/-! ### Change of measure into `L²`

The analytic engine for both the existence theorem and the closedness of the moment set is
weak compactness of the class of critical functions. `ForMathlib/TestsWeakCompact` supplies
it for `L²` over a **finite** measure; the three private lemmas below transport the problem
there. The classical route via `L^∞(μ) ≅ (L¹(μ))*` is *not* needed: because only finitely
many integrable functions are paired against the tests, one may reweight `μ` so that the
`L¹` pairing becomes an `L²` pairing over a finite measure. -/

/-- **The reweighting.** For finitely many integrable `fᵢ` over a σ-finite `μ` there are a
finite measure `ν` with `μ ≪ ν` and elements `gᵢ ∈ L²(ν)` such that pairing a test against
`gᵢ` in `L²(ν)` computes its `fᵢ`-moment under `μ`.

Concretely: pick a strictly positive integrable `h` (`exists_pos_lintegral_lt_of_sigmaFinite`),
set `w = (∑ᵢ|fᵢ|) + h > 0` (integrable) and `ν = μ.withDensity (ENNReal.ofReal ∘ w)`, a finite
measure with the same null sets as `μ`. The functions `gᵢ = fᵢ / w` lie in `L²(ν)` — the weight
dominates each `fᵢ`, so `∫ gᵢ² dν = ∫ fᵢ²/w dμ ≤ ∫ |fᵢ| dμ < ∞` — and the pairing is preserved,
`∫ φ gᵢ dν = ∫ φ fᵢ dμ`. -/

**Proof.** Transport the problem into `L²(ν)` along `exists_l2_reduction`; the constraint
class becomes `constrainedTestClassL2 ν (g ∘ Fin.castSucc) c`, which is nonempty by
hypothesis and weak-* compact (`ForMathlib/TestsWeakCompact`), so the moment functional
`⟪g_{m+1}, ·⟫` attains its maximum there (`exists_max_inner_of_constraints`). Truncating an
`L²` representative of the maximizer back to `[0,1]` produces the critical function. -/

/-! ### The supporting hyperplane at the top of the constrained fibre -/

/-- **Undetermined multipliers exist.** If the constraint vector `c` is an inner point of the
projected moment set and `φ₀` maximizes `∫ φ f_{m+1} dμ` over the constraint class, then there
are multipliers `k` for which `φ₀` maximizes the *Lagrangian* over **all** critical functions.

**Proof.** Work in the full moment body `M = momentSet μ f ⊆ ℝ^{m+1}`, a convex set whose last
coordinate is bounded below by `−B` with `B = ∫|f_{m+1}|dμ`; put `β = ∫φ₀f_{m+1}dμ` and let `z`
be the moment vector of `φ₀`. Fix `ε > 0` with the closed `ε`-ball around `c` inside the
projected moment set. A reflection argument bounds the last coordinate along `M` by the
*convex* function `u ↦ β + Lip‖u − c‖`, `Lip = (|β| + B)/ε`: for `y ∈ M` lying over `c + d`
with `d ≠ 0`, the reflected point `c − (ε/‖d‖)d` is still in the projected moment set, and the
convex combination of `y` with a lift of it lands over `c`, so cannot exceed `β`. Hence the open
convex strict epigraph `U` of that function is disjoint from `M`, and `geometric_hahn_banach_open`
separates them. Evaluating the separating functional along the vertical ray through `z` forces
its last coefficient `b` to be negative and pins the separating constant to `L z`; the multipliers
are `kᵢ = −wᵢ/b`.

Note that no interior point of `M` itself is needed — the Lipschitz majorant replaces the usual
supporting-hyperplane-at-a-boundary-point argument, which would require `M` to have nonempty
interior (false exactly when `f_{m+1}` is an a.e. linear combination of the `fᵢ`). -/
