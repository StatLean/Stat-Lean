# Least favorable distributions: reducing a composite hypothesis to a simple one

To test a composite hypothesis `H : {f_θ, θ ∈ ω}` against a simple alternative `g`, replace
`H` by the **simple** hypothesis `H_Λ` whose density is the mixture
$$ h_\Lambda(x) \;=\; \int_\omega f_\theta(x) \, d\Lambda(\theta) $$
over a prior `Λ` carried by `ω`. The fundamental lemma solves the mixed problem. If the
resulting most powerful test happens to keep size `≤ α` against **every** member of `ω`,
then it is most powerful for the original composite problem, and `Λ` is a *least
favorable* prior: no other prior makes the testing problem harder.

Contents:
* `mixtureMeasure μ f Λ` — the mixed hypothesis `H_Λ`;
* `maxPower P₀ G α` — the largest power against `G` available to a level-`α` test of `P₀`;
* `IsLeastFavorable` — `Λ` minimizes that quantity over priors carried by `ω`;
* `isMostPowerful_composite_of_leastFavorable` — the mixed-problem optimum solves the
  composite problem;
* `unique_mostPowerful_composite_of_leastFavorable` — the same transfer for uniqueness;
* `leastFavorable_max_power` — such a `Λ` is least favorable;
* `isMostPowerful_composite_of_npShape` — the practical sufficient condition: a
  likelihood-ratio test against the mixture, whose power is constant `= α` on a
  `Λ`-carrier `ω' ⊆ ω` and `≤ α` on all of `ω`, is most powerful.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and J.P. Romano, *Testing Statistical Hypotheses*, 4th ed.,
Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2022 (ISBN 978-3-030-70577-0), Chapter 3 (Uniformly Most
Powerful Tests), §3.8 (Least Favorable Distributions), Theorem 3.8.1 and Corollary 3.8.1
(reduction of a composite null to a simple one via a least favorable distribution). (`TSH4
§3.8 Thm 3.8.1, Cor 3.8.1`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The prior is carried as a measure `Λ : Measure Θ` on the parameter space together with
  `Λ ω = 1`, rather than as a measure on the subtype `ω`. This keeps `power P φ θ` and
  `IsLevel P ω φ α` usable verbatim, and makes "`Λ'` ranges over priors over `ω`" a plain
  side condition rather than a change of ambient type.
* Joint measurability of `(θ, x) ↦ f_θ(x)` is a genuine external input: it is what makes
  `h_Λ` measurable and lets Fubini give `∫ h_Λ dμ = 1`, i.e. that the mixture really is a
  probability density. It cannot be derived from measurability in `x` for each fixed `θ`.
* `maxPower` is a supremum of real numbers over a nonempty set bounded by `1` whenever
  `0 ≤ α`; for `α < 0` the competitor set is empty and the junk value is `0` (Mathlib's
  `sSup ∅`). The theorems below all carry `0 ≤ α`.
* Uniqueness is rendered as `μ`-a.e. equality of critical functions, which is the only
  sense in which a test is ever determined.
* The sufficient condition transcribes the printed pair of conditions faithfully: power
  exactly `α` at every point of the carrier `ω'`, and power at most `α` everywhere on `ω`
  (together these say the supremum over `ω` is attained and equals `α`, since `Λ ω' = 1`
  forces `ω'` to be nonempty).

**Bibliographic comments.** Reducing a composite hypothesis by averaging its members
against a weight function goes back to A. Wald ("Tests of statistical hypotheses
concerning several parameters when the number of observations is large," *Trans. Amer.
Math. Soc.* **54** (1943), 426–482), and the notion of a least favorable prior is central
to A. Wald, *Statistical Decision Functions* (Wiley, 1950). The existence theory and the
transfer results formalized here are due to E. L. Lehmann ("On the existence of least
favorable distributions," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **23** (1952), 408–416); the underlying
optimality of the likelihood-ratio test is J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson (*Phil. Trans. R.
Soc. Lond. A* **231** (1933), 289–337).

mixture `h_Λ(x) = ∫ f_θ(x) dΛ(θ)` of the family against the prior. When the inner integral
fails to converge the Bochner integral returns `0` (Mathlib's junk convention); the
theorems below carry the joint-measurability hypothesis that rules this out.

/-- **The practical sufficient condition.** Let `Λ` be a prior carried by a subset
`ω' ⊆ ω` with `Λ ω' = 1`, and let `φ` be a likelihood-ratio test of the mixture density
against `g` at some threshold `k`. If the power of `φ` is exactly `α` at every point of
`ω'` and at most `α` on all of `ω`, then `φ` is most powerful at level `α` for the
composite problem. -/
