# The fundamental lemma of testing a simple hypothesis against a simple alternative

Let `P₀` and `P₁` be probability measures with densities `p₀`, `p₁` with respect to a
σ-finite measure `μ`. The **likelihood-ratio test** with threshold `C` and boundary
randomization `γ`,
$$ \varphi(x) \;=\; \begin{cases} 1 & p_1(x) > C\,p_0(x), \\
\gamma & p_1(x) = C\,p_0(x), \\ 0 & p_1(x) < C\,p_0(x), \end{cases} $$
is optimal in the strongest possible sense: a suitable `(C, γ)` achieves **exactly** size
`α`, every test of that shape and size is most powerful, and — conversely — every most
powerful test has that shape almost everywhere.

Contents:
* `HasDensity μ p P` — `P = p·μ` for a nonnegative measurable `p` (the dominated setup);
* `npTest p₀ p₁ C γ` — the likelihood-ratio test above;
* `exists_mostPowerful` — existence of `(C, γ)` with size exactly `α`, and optimality;
* `isMostPowerful_of_npShape`, `isMostPowerful_npTest` — sufficiency;
* `npTest_necessity` — necessity of the shape a.e., plus the exact-size clause;
* `power_gt_alpha_of_ne`, `power_eq_alpha_of_eq` — strict unbiasedness, and the honest
  degenerate case.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and J.P. Romano, *Testing Statistical Hypotheses*, 4th ed.,
Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2022 (ISBN 978-3-030-70577-0), Chapter 3 (Uniformly Most
Powerful Tests), §3.2 (The Neyman–Pearson Fundamental Lemma), Theorem 3.2.1 (the fundamental
lemma: existence, sufficiency and necessity of the likelihood-ratio form) and Corollary 3.2.1
(strict unbiasedness unless the two distributions coincide). (`TSH4 §3.2 Thm 3.2.1, Cor
3.2.1`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The threshold lives in `ℝ≥0∞`: this is what admits the corner value `C = ∞` needed for
  `α = 0`, and it makes the convention "`0 · ∞ = 0`" (used exactly at that corner) the
  ambient `ENNReal` arithmetic rather than a side convention. The comparison is therefore
  `C * ENNReal.ofReal (p₀ x) < ENNReal.ofReal (p₁ x)` rather than a real inequality.
* The classical construction takes `α(c) = P₀{p₁/p₀ > c}`; `1 - α` is a cumulative
  distribution function, so `α(c)` is nonincreasing and right-continuous, and the
  boundary weight is `γ = (α - α(C))/(α(C⁻) - α(C))` whenever the denominator is nonzero.
  The `ℝ≥0∞` formulation avoids forming the ratio `p₁/p₀` at all.
* The necessity statement is transcribed with its escape clause: exact size `α` is forced
  only when no test of size `< α` already has power `1`.
* `HasDensity` is a local convenience predicate for the dominated setup; it is a
  candidate for promotion into the shared test-layer data model.

**Bibliographic comments.** The lemma, the randomized-test formulation, and the
existence/sufficiency/necessity trichotomy are due to J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson ("On
the problem of the most efficient tests of statistical hypotheses," *Phil. Trans. R. Soc.
Lond. A* **231** (1933), 289–337), with the systematic treatment of the boundary
randomization in J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson ("Contributions to the theory of testing
statistical hypotheses," *Stat. Res. Mem.* **1** (1936), 1–37). Measure-theoretic
formulations under an arbitrary dominating measure were given by G. B. Dantzig and
A. Wald ("On the fundamental lemma of Neyman and Pearson," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **22**
(1951), 87–93).

/-- `P` **has density** `p` with respect to `μ`: `p` is measurable and nonnegative and
`P = p·μ`. This is the dominated setup "`P` possesses the density `p` with respect to
the measure `μ`"; nonnegativity is carried explicitly because densities are real-valued
here, and `ENNReal.ofReal` would otherwise silently truncate. -/

/-- The **Neyman–Pearson (likelihood-ratio) test** with threshold `C : ℝ≥0∞` and boundary
randomization `γ`: reject when `p₁ > C·p₀`, reject with probability `γ` when
`p₁ = C·p₀`, accept when `p₁ < C·p₀`.

The threshold is extended-nonnegative-real so that the corner `C = ∞` (needed for
`α = 0`) is available and `0 · ∞ = 0` is the ambient arithmetic. For `C = 0` the test
rejects wherever `p₁ > 0`. No constraint is imposed on `γ` by the definition: for `γ`
outside `[0,1]` the result is not a critical function, and the theorems below therefore
carry `γ ∈ [0,1]` explicitly. -/

set `{p₁ = C·p₀}`. This is the almost-everywhere form of the displayed test above, and

everywhere for some threshold `C`; and its size is exactly `α` **unless** there already
exists a test of size strictly below `α` whose power against the alternative is `1`.

Both clauses are transcribed as stated: the shape is only claimed `μ`-a.e. (nothing is
claimed on the boundary set), and the exact-size clause is guarded by its escape
hypothesis rather than asserted unconditionally. -/
