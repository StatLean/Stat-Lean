# The sign-change randomization test is asymptotically normal

For i.i.d. real observations $X_1, \dots, X_n$ the natural randomization group is the
group of **sign changes**: $\varepsilon = (\varepsilon_1, \dots, \varepsilon_n)$ with
$\varepsilon_i \in \{\pm 1\}$ acting by
$(\varepsilon \cdot x)_i = \varepsilon_i x_i$, a group of order $2^n$. If the common law
is symmetric about $0$ the randomization hypothesis holds, and the resulting test is exact
at every sample size. The point of this file is what happens *asymptotically*, in
particular when symmetry fails.

Assume the statistic is **asymptotically linear**,
$$ T_n = n^{-1/2}\sum_{i=1}^n \psi(X_i) + o_P(1), \qquad
   \tau^2 = \operatorname{Var}[\psi(X_1)] < \infty , $$
with $\psi$ an **odd** function. Then:

* if the common law is symmetric about $0$, the randomization distribution satisfies
  $\hat R_n(t) \xrightarrow{P} \Phi(t/\tau)$;
* if it is not, let $\tilde P$ be its **symmetrization**, the law with c.d.f.
  $\tilde F(t) = \tfrac12\bigl[F(t) + 1 - F(-t)\bigr]$, and assume asymptotic linearity
  under $\tilde P$; then, still under the original law,
  $\hat R_n(t) \xrightarrow{P} \Phi(t/\tau(\tilde P))$ and
  $\hat r_n(1-\alpha) \xrightarrow{P} \tau(\tilde P)\, z_{1-\alpha}$.

The second part is the reason the sign-change test is usable without symmetry: the
randomization distribution still stabilizes, at the symmetrized model's scale.

Randomization Tests), §17.2 (Permutation and Randomization Tests), Theorem 17.2.4 (the
sign-change randomization distribution is asymptotically normal). (`TSH4 §17.2 Thm 17.2.4`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* *The sign-change group.* It is `Fin n → ℤˣ`: the units of `ℤ` are exactly `±1`, so this
  is `{±1}ⁿ` on the nose, a finite abelian group of order `2ⁿ` (`card_signChangeGroup`).
  Its action on `Fin n → ℝ` is Mathlib's componentwise action, obtained by composing
  `Pi.mulAction'` (a product of monoids acting componentwise), `Units.instMulAction`
  (`u • a = (u : M) • a`) and the `ℤ`-module structure of `ℝ`; no new instance is declared
  here, and `signChange_smul_apply` pins the resulting formula
  `(ε • x) i = εᵢ · xᵢ` so that downstream proofs never have to unfold that chain.
* *Symmetrization.* `symmetrize P` is the equal mixture of `P` and its reflection, i.e.
  the law of `X` multiplied by an independent random sign. Its c.d.f. agrees with the
  book's $\tilde F(t) = \tfrac12[F(t) + 1 - F(-t)]$ at every continuity point of $F$; at an
  atom of $P$ located at $-t$ the two differ by half that atom's mass, because
  $1 - F(-t)$ is the *open* upper tail while the reflected measure contributes the closed
  one. The mixture form is the standard object and is what the argument uses (the
  randomization distribution depends on the data only through $|X_1|, \dots, |X_n|$, whose
  law is the same under `P` and `symmetrize P`).
* *Mean-zero is not a hypothesis.* Oddness of `ψ` together with symmetry of the law and
  square-integrability already force $E[\psi(X_1)] = 0$; carrying it as an assumption
  would be laundering a derivable fact through the signature. It is therefore omitted, and
  `τ²` is stated as the **second moment** $\int \psi^2$, which equals the variance exactly
  because the mean vanishes.
* *Nondegeneracy.* `0 < τ` is required so that `Φ(t/τ)` is a c.d.f.; the degenerate case
  `τ = 0` has no limiting distribution of this form.
* *Asymptotic linearity* is stated with the triangular-array convergence in probability of
  `Randomization/Asymptotics`, applied to the remainder
  `T n x − n^{-1/2} ∑ᵢ ψ(xᵢ)`; that is exactly the `o_P(1)` of the display.
* The limit is reached through the bivariate sign-change central limit theorem of the sibling
  file `Randomization/PairCLT` (`weakConverges_randPairLaw_signSum`). That engine works at the
  level of characteristic functions: averaging over the four sign pairs `(s,s') ∈ {±1}²`
  factorizes the joint characteristic function across coordinates *exactly at every finite `n`*,
  so asymptotic independence of the two randomized copies is not a limiting phenomenon but an
  identity, and no mean-zero hypothesis is needed. The passage from the statistic to its linear
  part is `PairCLT.weakConverges_randPairLaw_of_tendstoInProb`, a Slutsky transfer that consumes
  exactly the `o_P(1)` of `hlin` together with sign-invariance of `⊗ⁿP` (which is `hsymm`).
* Oddness of `ψ` enters through the equivariance `ψ(εᵢxᵢ) = εᵢψ(xᵢ)`, which lets the
  coordinatewise map `x ↦ (ψ(xᵢ))ᵢ` intertwine the two sign actions; `randPairLaw_comp` then
  transports the whole randomized pair to the pushforward law `P.map ψ`.

**Bibliographic comments.** Sign-change (randomization) tests for a symmetric location
model go back to R. A. Fisher (*The Design of Experiments*, Oliver & Boyd, Edinburgh,
1935) and E. J. G. Pitman ("Significance tests which may be applied to samples from any
populations," *J. R. Statist. Soc. Suppl.* **4** (1937), 119–130), with the group-theoretic
exactness in E. L. Lehmann and C. Stein ("On the theory of some non-parametric
hypotheses," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **20** (1949), 28–45). The large-sample analysis is due
to W. Hoeffding ("The large-sample power of tests based on permutations of observations,"
*Ann. Math. Statist.* **23** (1952), 169–192); the behaviour without the group invariance
assumption, i.e. the asymmetric case handled here through symmetrization, is
J. P. Romano ("On the behavior of randomization tests without a group invariance
assumption," *J. Amer. Statist. Assoc.* **85** (1990), 686–692), sharpened by E. Chung and
J. P. Romano ("Exact and asymptotically robust permutation tests," *Ann. Statist.* **41**
(2013), 484–507).

is *not* symmetric about `0`, asymptotic linearity is assumed under the symmetrized law

model's Gaussian, not to the true sampling distribution. -/
