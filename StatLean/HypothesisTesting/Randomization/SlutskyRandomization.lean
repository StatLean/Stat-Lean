# A Slutsky theorem for randomization distributions

Randomization distributions are usually built from a statistic that is itself a rescaled
and recentred version of a simpler one — studentization being the canonical example. This
file supplies the Slutsky-type transfer: if the base statistic satisfies the joint
asymptotic-independence condition, and the random scaling and shift stabilize at
constants, then the randomization distribution of the affine combination converges to the
law of the correspondingly transformed limit.

Given statistic sequences $T_n$, $A_n$, $B_n$, write
$$ \hat R_n^{AT+B}(t) \;=\; |\mathbf{G}_n|^{-1} \sum_{g \in \mathbf{G}_n}
   \mathbf{1}\bigl\{A_n(gX^n)\,T_n(gX^n) + B_n(gX^n) \le t\bigr\} $$
for the randomization distribution of the transformed statistic. If
$(T_n(G_nX^n), T_n(G_n'X^n)) \xrightarrow{d} (T, T')$ with $T, T'$ independent and
$R$-distributed, and if $A_n(G_nX^n) \xrightarrow{P} a$, $B_n(G_nX^n) \xrightarrow{P} b$,
then
$$ \hat R_n^{AT+B}(t) \;\xrightarrow{P}\; R^{aT+b}(t) $$
at every continuity point of the law $R^{aT+b}$ of $aT + b$.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* *The exact requirement on the random scalings.* No invariance of $A_n$ or $B_n$ under
  the group is assumed — this is worth stating plainly, because it is the natural guess
  and it is not what the hypothesis says. What is required is that the scalings converge
  in probability **when evaluated at the randomized data** $G_nX^n$, with $G_n$ uniform on
  the group and independent of $X^n$ — not at $X^n$ itself. Since the group is finite and
  $G_n$ is uniform, that is the mixture statement
  $|\mathbf{G}_n|^{-1}\sum_g P_n\{|A_n(g\cdot x) - a| \ge \varepsilon\} \to 0$, which is
  the definition of `TendstoInProbRandomized`. In the studentized application the scaling
  is a pooled sample variance, which is *not* invariant under the group; what is true, and
  what the hypothesis captures, is that it converges in probability under a random
  relabelling.
* Correspondingly, the randomization distribution being transformed evaluates $A_n$ and
  $B_n$ at $gX^n$ too, matching the display above; the statistic whose randomization
  distribution is taken is the pointwise combination `fun y => A n y * T n y + B n y`.
* The limit law is written as the pushforward `R.map (fun u => a * u + b)`, i.e. the law of
  $aT + b$.
* *A caveat on the inversion formula.* The classical parenthetical
  $R^{aT+b}(t) = R^{T}((t-b)/a)$ "for $a \ne 0$" is correct only for $a > 0$: for $a < 0$
  the affine map reverses order and the identity picks up a reflection,
  $P\{aT + b \le t\} = 1 - P\{T < (t-b)/a\}$, which differs from
  $R^{T}((t-b)/a)$ unless $R^{T}$ is continuous there. `cdf_map_affine` is therefore stated
  for `0 < a` only; that is the case every application needs (scalings are positive).
* The setting is the same triangular array as `Randomization/Asymptotics`, whose
  `TendstoInProbTriangular` and `randPairLaw` are reused verbatim.

**Bibliographic comments.** The transfer principle for randomization distributions under
random rescaling, and its use to justify studentized permutation tests, is due to
A. Janssen ("Studentized permutation tests for non-i.i.d. hypotheses and the generalized
Behrens–Fisher problem," *Statist. Probab. Lett.* **36** (1997), 9–21) and was developed
into a general theory by E. Chung and J. P. Romano ("Exact and asymptotically robust
permutation tests," *Ann. Statist.* **41** (2013), 484–507), building on
J. P. Romano ("Bootstrap and randomization tests of some nonparametric hypotheses," *Ann.
Statist.* **17** (1989), 141–159; "On the behavior of randomization tests without a group
invariance assumption," *J. Amer. Statist. Assoc.* **85** (1990), 686–692) and on the
large-sample framework of W. Hoeffding ("The large-sample power of tests based on
permutations of observations," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **23** (1952), 169–192).
