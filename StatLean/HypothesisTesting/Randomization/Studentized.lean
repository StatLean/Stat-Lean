# The studentized two-sample permutation test

The unstudentized two-sample permutation test compares a statistic whose permutation
variance $\lambda\sigma^2(P_Y) + \sigma^2(P_Z)$ differs from its true sampling variance
$\sigma^2(P_Y) + \lambda\sigma^2(P_Z)$ whenever the variances differ and the sample sizes
are unbalanced, so its asymptotic rejection probability need not equal $\alpha$ for testing
equality of *means*. Studentizing repairs this. Put
$$ \tilde T_{m,n} = \frac{T_{m,n}}{D_{m,n}}, \qquad
   D_{m,n}^2 = S_Y^2 + \frac{m}{n} S_Z^2 , $$
with $S_Y^2 = m^{-1}\sum_i (Y_i - \bar Y_m)^2$ and
$S_Z^2 = n^{-1}\sum_j (Z_j - \bar Z_n)^2$. Then

* the randomization distribution of $\tilde T_{m,n}$ converges in probability to the
  standard normal c.d.f., $\hat R^{\tilde T}_{m,n}(t) \xrightarrow{P} \Phi(t)$;
* the unconditional law also converges, $\tilde T_{m,n} \xrightarrow{d} N(0,1)$;

so the two match and the permutation test based on $\tilde T_{m,n}$ is asymptotically
level $\alpha$ — pointwise consistent in level — **even when the two populations have
different variances and the sample sizes are unbalanced**. When the populations are
identical the randomization hypothesis holds and the test is additionally *exact* at every
finite sample size, so studentization costs nothing.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and J.P. Romano, *Testing Statistical Hypotheses*, 4th ed.,
Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2022 (ISBN 978-3-030-70577-0), Chapter 17 (Permutation and
Randomization Tests), §17.3 (Two-Sample Permutation Tests), Theorem 17.3.3 (asymptotic
validity of the studentized two-sample permutation test). (`TSH4 §17.3 Thm 17.3.3`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* *The exact studentization.* The scale is the one displayed above, $D^2 = S_Y^2 +
  (m/n)S_Z^2$, with both sample variances normalized by the sample size (not by
  $m-1$, $n-1$); this is the divisor the statement is proved with, and it is what makes
  $\tilde T_{m,n}$ pivotal.
* *Relation to the two-sample $t$-statistic.* Dividing numerator and denominator by
  $\sqrt m$ turns $\tilde T_{m,n}$ into
  $(\bar Y_m - \bar Z_n)/\sqrt{S_Y^2/m + S_Z^2/n}$, i.e. the two-sample $t$-statistic with
  **unpooled (Welch) standardization**; `studentizedTwoSample_eq_welch` records this
  algebraic identity. So the level statement below applies verbatim to that statistic
  without any equal-variance assumption. This is a different claim from the classical
  remark that the *pooled* two-sample $t$-test is asymptotically equivalent to the
  unstudentized permutation test — that comparison does require equal variances (or
  $\lambda = 1$), and is not asserted here.
* *Route.* Combining the two-sample permutation limit for the numerator with the Slutsky
  transfer for randomization distributions reduces the claim to showing that the
  studentizing scale, evaluated at a random permutation of the pooled data, converges in
  probability to the permutation scale $\tau$. That is a statement about the first two
  moments of a random sample drawn without replacement from the pooled data, and it is why
  the scale is *not* assumed group-invariant anywhere: it is not, and the Slutsky transfer
  is stated exactly to accommodate that.
* *Degenerate corners.* `twoSampleScale` can vanish (constant data), in which case
  `studentizedTwoSample` returns the junk value `x / 0 = 0`; the statistic is total. Under
  the standing hypotheses (nonzero population variances, sample sizes tending to infinity)
  the scale is eventually positive with probability tending to one, so the corner is
  asymptotically negligible rather than excluded by fiat.
* *No equal-variance hypothesis appears in any statement below* — that absence is the
  content of the theorem.

**Bibliographic comments.** That studentization restores asymptotic validity of the
two-sample permutation test under unequal variances is due to A. Janssen ("Studentized
permutation tests for non-i.i.d. hypotheses and the generalized Behrens–Fisher problem,"
*Statist. Probab. Lett.* **36** (1997), 9–21); the general principle — construct test
statistics whose limiting distribution is free of unknown parameters — was developed by
E. Chung and J. P. Romano ("Exact and asymptotically robust permutation tests," *Ann.
Statist.* **41** (2013), 484–507). The failure it repairs was identified by J. P. Romano
("On the behavior of randomization tests without a group invariance assumption," *J. Amer.
Statist. Assoc.* **85** (1990), 686–692; see also "Bootstrap and randomization tests of
some nonparametric hypotheses," *Ann. Statist.* **17** (1989), 141–159). The underlying
permutation limit theory is W. Hoeffding ("The large-sample power of tests based on
permutations of observations," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **23** (1952), 169–192), and the
exact finite-sample theory R. A. Fisher (*The Design of Experiments*, Oliver & Boyd,
Edinburgh, 1935), E. J. G. Pitman ("Significance tests which may be applied to samples
from any populations," *J. R. Statist. Soc. Suppl.* **4** (1937), 119–130) and
E. L. Lehmann and C. Stein ("On the theory of some non-parametric hypotheses," *Ann. Math.
Statist.* **20** (1949), 28–45); sampling the group rather than enumerating it is
M. Dwass ("Modified randomization tests for nonparametric hypotheses," *Ann. Math.
Statist.* **28** (1957), 181–187).

/-! ### A small calculus for convergence in probability along a triangular array

The studentizing scale is built from the sample moments by four operations — sum, product
with a deterministic factor, square root, reciprocal — and the argument needs each of them to
pass to the limit *in probability*, on a space that changes with `n`. Mathlib's continuous
mapping theorems are for a fixed space, so the three closure properties are recorded here in
the `TendstoInProbTriangular`-style `Measure.real` form used throughout this directory. -/

`TendstoInProbRandomized` — the hypothesis the Slutsky transfer consumes — evaluates the
scaling at `g · x` with `g` uniform on the group, so it is a convex combination of the
per-`g` failure probabilities. The two closure properties needed below are therefore proved
exactly as their fixed-measure counterparts above, one group element at a time. -/

/-! ### Truncation: dropping the second-moment hypothesis

Applying the Chebyshev bound above to `f = (·)²` would cost a fourth pooled moment, which
`MemLp id 2` does not supply. The standard remedy for sampling without replacement is to
truncate: the truncated function is bounded, hence square integrable, and the discarded part
is controlled in `L¹` *uniformly in `k`*, because the group average of a permuted block
average of a nonnegative function is exactly the pooled average of that function
(`avg_perm_blockAvg_eq`), whose expectation is the convex combination of the two population
integrals. -/

/-- **The randomized block average converges, assuming only integrability.** This is the
generic hypergeometric input of Theorem 17.3.3: for an integrable `f`, the average of `f`
over a block of `p k` positions of a uniformly permuted pooled sample converges, in the
group-averaged in-probability sense, to the pooled mixture
`λ/(1+λ) · ∫f dP_Y + 1/(1+λ) · ∫f dP_Z`. Applied to `f = id` it gives the block means and to
`f = (·)²` the block second moments, which is all the studentizing scale is made of. -/

/-! ### The randomized studentizing scale

Under a uniform permutation of the pooled data each block is a sample **without
replacement** from the pooled `N = m + n` values, so — unlike the unconditional scale of
`tendstoInProb_twoSampleScale`, which converges to `s² = σ²(P_Y) + λσ²(P_Z)` — *both* block
variances converge to the same pooled variance
$$ \bar v = \frac{\lambda \sigma^2(P_Y) + \sigma^2(P_Z)}{1 + \lambda} , $$
whence `D_{m,n}(π·)² = S²_Y(π·) + (m/n) S²_Z(π·) → (1 + λ)\bar v = τ²`. The two limits differ
exactly when `λ ≠ 1` and the variances differ — the failure of the *unstudentized* test —
and dividing by the scale sends both to `N(0,1)`, which is the content of this file. -/

/-- **The studentizing scale, evaluated at randomized data, is consistent for `τ`**, the

  -- Route, exactly as the wave-5 note laid it out:
  -- (a) the group-average calculus (`tendstoInProbRandomized_add`, `_const_mul`, `_comp`,
  --     `_congr`) reduces the square root, the sum and the factor `m/n` to the two block
  --     variances;
  -- (b) `ForMathlib/PermutationMarginals` supplies the exact `O(1/p)` variance of a
  --     permuted block average and the Chebyshev step over the group;
  -- (c) recentring against the pooled mean is `perm_avg_indicator_blockAvg_inv_sub_mean_le`
  --     and the exchange of the group average with the data law is
  --     `avg_measureReal_eq_integral_avg_indicator`; the resulting integral is bounded
  --     uniformly by `perm_avg_block_sub_pooled_le`, whence
  --     `tendstoInProbRandomized_blockAvg_of_sq`;
  -- (d) the fourth-moment obstruction for the block SECOND moments is removed by
  --     truncation: `tendstoInProbRandomized_blockAvg` pays for the discarded part with the
  --     `L¹` tail bound `perm_avg_blockAvg_tail_le`, which is uniform in `k` because the
  --     group average of a permuted block average is *exactly* the pooled average
  --     (`avg_perm_blockAvg_eq`);
  -- (e) the pooled empirical moments converge by `tendstoInProb_pooledAvg`, giving the same
  --     limit `v̄ = (λ varY + varZ)/(1 + λ)` for BOTH blocks and `τ² = (1 + λ) v̄`.
