# The two-sample permutation central limit theorem

Two independent samples $Y_1, \dots, Y_m \sim P_Y$ and $Z_1, \dots, Z_n \sim P_Z$ are
pooled into $X = (Y_1, \dots, Y_m, Z_1, \dots, Z_n)$ of length $N = m + n$, and the
permutation group of $\{1, \dots, N\}$ acts by relabelling coordinates. The statistic is
the scaled difference of sample means
$$ T_{m,n} = m^{1/2}\bigl(\bar Y_m - \bar Z_n\bigr) . $$

Assume $m/n \to \lambda \in (0, \infty)$, finite nonzero variances, and equal means
$\mu(P_Y) = \mu(P_Z)$. The **permutation** limit is
$$ \bigl(T_{m,n}(\pi X),\, T_{m,n}(\pi' X)\bigr) \;\xrightarrow{d}\;
   N(0, \tau^2) \otimes N(0, \tau^2), \qquad
   \tau^2 = \lambda\,\sigma^2(P_Y) + \sigma^2(P_Z) , $$
for two independent uniform random permutations $\pi, \pi'$, so the randomization
distribution satisfies $\hat R_{m,n}(t) \xrightarrow{P} \Phi(t/\tau)$.

The **unconditional** limit is a different Gaussian,
$$ T_{m,n} \;\xrightarrow{d}\; N\bigl(0, \sigma^2(P_Y) + \lambda\,\sigma^2(P_Z)\bigr) , $$
with the roles of $\lambda$ and the two variances exchanged. The two variances coincide
exactly when $\lambda = 1$ or $\sigma^2(P_Y) = \sigma^2(P_Z)$ — which is precisely why the
unstudentized permutation test can fail to be asymptotically level $\alpha$ for testing
equality of *means* when the variances differ and the sample sizes are unbalanced, and why
the studentized version of the companion file is needed.

permutation central limit theorem). (`TSH4 §17.3 Thm 17.3.1`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* *The permutation action.* `Equiv.Perm (Fin N)` acts on `Fin N → ℝ` through Mathlib's
  `arrowAction`, declared here as a scoped instance since Mathlib deliberately leaves it a
  plain definition. This gives `(σ • x) i = x (σ⁻¹ i)`, whereas the classical display
  writes `(σ • x) i = x (σ i)`. The two conventions differ by inversion, a bijection of the
  group, so every group-averaged object — `randDist`, `randTest`, `randPValue`,
  `randPairLaw` — is literally unchanged; only the labelling of individual summands moves.
* *The pooled law.* `twoSampleLaw` is the product measure on `Fin (m + n) → ℝ` whose first
  `m` coordinates are `P_Y` and whose last `n` are `P_Z`, assembled with `Fin.addCases`.
  Independence within and across the two samples is exactly the product structure.
* *Degenerate corners.* `twoSampleMeanDiff` uses `(m : ℝ)⁻¹` and `(n : ℝ)⁻¹`, which are
  `0` when the sample is empty; the statistic is therefore total, with junk value at
  `m = 0` or `n = 0`. The theorems send both sample sizes to infinity, so those corners are
  never reached.
* *Both scales are carried explicitly.* `τ` is the permutation scale and `s` the
  unconditional one, each introduced with its defining equation (`τ² = λσ²_Y + σ²_Z`,
  `s² = σ²_Y + λσ²_Z`) and a positivity hypothesis. Writing them as separate parameters
  keeps the asymmetry — the whole content of the comparison — visible in the signatures.
* *Route to the limit.* Conditionally on the permutation weights, the statistic is a
  weighted sum of independent terms; the Cramér–Wold device reduces the bivariate claim to
  a scalar one, and the weighted i.i.d. central limit theorem of the sibling brick
  `StatLean.HypothesisTesting.ForMathlib.LindebergCLT` supplies the scalar limit. The
  weights are indicators of sampling **without replacement**, so their moments — the
  variance of the weight average and the covariance across two independent permutations —
  come from the sibling brick
  `StatLean.HypothesisTesting.ForMathlib.HypergeometricMoments`.
* The statement is deliberately given in the `WeakConverges`-to-a-product form, so that it
  plugs directly into the joint hypothesis of
  `randDist_tendstoInProb_cdf` in `Randomization/Asymptotics`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The permutation test for the two-sample problem is due to
R. A. Fisher (*The Design of Experiments*, Oliver & Boyd, Edinburgh, 1935) and
E. J. G. Pitman ("Significance tests which may be applied to samples from any
populations," *J. R. Statist. Soc. Suppl.* **4** (1937), 119–130); exactness under the
group formulation is E. L. Lehmann and C. Stein ("On the theory of some non-parametric
hypotheses," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **20** (1949), 28–45), and the sampled-group variant is
M. Dwass ("Modified randomization tests for nonparametric hypotheses," *Ann. Math.
Statist.* **28** (1957), 181–187). The large-sample theory of permutation statistics is
W. Hoeffding ("The large-sample power of tests based on permutations of observations,"
*Ann. Math. Statist.* **23** (1952), 169–192). That the unstudentized two-sample
permutation test can fail asymptotically under unequal variances was established by
J. P. Romano ("On the behavior of randomization tests without a group invariance
assumption," *J. Amer. Statist. Assoc.* **85** (1990), 686–692; see also "Bootstrap and
randomization tests of some nonparametric hypotheses," *Ann. Statist.* **17** (1989),
141–159), with the general theory in E. Chung and J. P. Romano ("Exact and asymptotically
robust permutation tests," *Ann. Statist.* **41** (2013), 484–507).

/-! ### The permuted statistic as a block sum

Under a uniform permutation the two-sample statistic is *exactly* a fixed positive multiple
of the sum of the **centred** pooled data over a block of `m` positions — that is, of a
simple random sample of size `m` drawn without replacement from the pooled population. This
is what puts the whole two-sample chain in the scope of the combinatorial central limit
theorem `ForMathlib/CombinatorialCLT.tendsto_perm_cdf_blockSum`: the sample means of the two
blocks are not independent, but their difference is an affine function of one block sum, and
the pooled total drops out because it is permutation invariant. -/

/-! ### The combinatorial central limit theorem at a moving threshold

The two-sample statistic reaches the combinatorial central limit theorem through a threshold
that depends on the stage — the sample sizes and the pooled dispersion both move with `k` —
so the fixed-threshold form of `ForMathlib/CombinatorialCLT.tendsto_perm_cdf_blockSum` is
squeezed here between its values at `t ∓ ε`. The indicator is monotone in the threshold and
`blockSumScale` is nonnegative, so the sandwich is immediate, and the limit `Φ` is Lipschitz,
hence continuous, so the two brackets close. -/

/-! ### From deterministic arrays to random arrays

The combinatorial central limit theorem is a statement about a *fixed* sequence of finite
populations, whereas the population a two-sample permutation test acts on is the observed
pooled sample, so its hypotheses hold only **in probability**. The following brick performs
that transfer once and for all, and it is exactly the step the wave-6 status note described:
no measurable selection is involved, only existence.

Given two nonnegative "hypothesis functionals" `A k`, `B k` that tend to `0` in probability,
and a bounded functional `F k` with the property that `F` converges to `L` along *every*
subsequence of deterministic points on which `A` and `B` vanish, one concludes that `F`
converges to `L` in probability. The proof is a contradiction: if `F` failed, a frequency
`δ > 0` of failures would persist, while the good sets `{A < 1/(j+1)} ∩ {B < 1/(j+1)}`
eventually have probability greater than `1 - 2δ/3`; the failure set therefore meets the good
set, which produces a deterministic sequence of points contradicting the hypothesis. -/

/-! ### A reusable `L¹` law of large numbers on `Measure.pi`

The randomization limits in this directory are all statements about product measures
`Measure.pi (fun _ : Fin n => P)` whose summands are only `L¹` — sample second moments of an
`L²` observation, for instance — so Chebyshev's inequality is unavailable and the honest
route is Kolmogorov's strong law. The following brick packages that route once: it lifts the
`Fin n` product to the Kolmogorov extension `Measure.infinitePi` on `ℕ → Ω`, applies
`ProbabilityTheory.strong_law_ae_real`, converts a.e. convergence to convergence in measure,
and pulls the resulting sets back along
`AsymptoticStatistics.pi_meas_eq_infinitePi_meas_of_truncate`.

It is stated in the `Measure.real` form the randomization `hrem` hypotheses consume, and is
used by `Randomization/MultivariateQuadratic` (consistency of the uncentred second-moment
matrix) and by `Randomization/Studentized` (consistency of the studentizing scale). -/

/-- **`L¹` weak law of large numbers on a finite product measure.** For an integrable `f`,
the empirical mean of `f` along the coordinates converges to `∫ f ∂P` in
`Measure.pi (fun _ : Fin n => P)`-probability as `n → ∞`.

Note the two-parameter structure: the *measure* and the *statistic* both depend on `n`, so
this is a triangular-array statement rather than a limit along a single probability space;
that is exactly why it goes through the Kolmogorov extension rather than through
`ProbabilityTheory.strong_law_ae_real` directly. -/

/-! ### Shared bricks: the pooled empirical average

The pooled-population hypotheses of the combinatorial central limit theorem are a pure
law-of-large-numbers statement about the *pooled empirical moments*, and the companion
file `Randomization/Studentized` needs exactly the same inputs for the studentizing
scale. They are therefore recorded here, below both consumers in the import graph: a
three-lemma calculus for convergence in probability along a triangular array, the two
block laws of large numbers obtained by pushing the pooled law onto each block, the two
deterministic weights `m/N → λ/(1+λ)` and `n/N → 1/(1+λ)`, and the pooled average
itself. -/

/-! ### A small calculus for convergence in probability along a triangular array

The studentizing scale is built from the sample moments by four operations — sum, product
with a deterministic factor, square root, reciprocal — and the argument needs each of them to
pass to the limit *in probability*, on a space that changes with `n`. Mathlib's continuous
mapping theorems are for a fixed space, so the three closure properties are recorded here in
the `TendstoInProbTriangular`-style `Measure.real` form used throughout this directory. -/

/-! ### The standardized pooled population and its two hypothesis functionals

The combinatorial central limit theorem asks for a centred population normalized in the
second moment and satisfying Hájek's Lindeberg condition. The pooled data supply the first
after division by the deterministic constant `√v̄`, `v̄ = (λ varY + varZ)/(1+λ)`; the second
holds only in probability, and — since the transfer brick above consumes a *single* scalar
functional rather than a family indexed by `ε` — it is packaged here as the single
**Lindeberg defect**
`Λ = N⁻¹ ∑ e² min(1, |e|/R)`, `R = √(min (m, N − m))`,
which dominates every member of the family: on `{|e| ≥ εR}` one has
`min(1, |e|/R) ≥ min(1, ε)`. -/

/-! ### The pooled empirical moments and the tail second moment

The two hypothesis functionals are, after dividing out the deterministic scale `v̄`, built
from three pooled empirical averages: the pooled mean `x̄`, the pooled variance
`N⁻¹ ∑ (x_l − x̄)²`, and — for the Lindeberg defect — the **tail second moment**
`N⁻¹ ∑ x_l² 1{|x_l| ≥ K}`. All three are instances of `tendstoInProb_pooledAvg`, and the
tail one converges, as `K → ∞`, to a limit that vanishes by dominated convergence. That is
the only place where `MemLp id 2` is used, and it is why no moment beyond `L²` is needed. -/

/-! ### The deterministic Lindeberg split

Off the tail `{|t| ≥ K}` the truncation factor `min(1, |x_l − x̄|/r)` is at most
`(K + |x̄|)/r`, which is deterministic and `o(1)` because `r = √v̄ · √(min(m,n)) → ∞`; on the
tail it is at most `1`, and `(x_l − x̄)² ≤ 2x_l² + 2x̄² ≤ 2(1 + x̄²) x_l²` there, because
`K ≥ 1` forces `x_l² ≥ 1`. No probability is involved. -/

/-- **The pooled population satisfies the hypotheses of the combinatorial central limit
theorem in probability.**

STATUS (wave 8): this is the single remaining debt of the two-sample chain, and it is now a
pure law-of-large-numbers statement about the *pooled empirical moments* — no permutation,
no central limit theorem, no measurable selection. Route (all inputs exist in the
repository):

* `Randomization/Studentized.tendstoInProb_pooledAvg` (proved in wave 8) gives, for every
  integrable `f`, `N⁻¹ ∑_l f(x_l) → (λ ∫f dP_Y + ∫f dP_Z)/(1+λ)` in probability, through
  the two block laws of large numbers `tendsto_lln_blockY`/`_blockZ` and the deterministic
  weights `m/N → λ/(1+λ)`, `n/N → 1/(1+λ)`. Applying it to `f = id` and `f = (·)²` and
  subtracting gives `N⁻¹ ∑_l (x_l − x̄)² → v̄` in probability, which is the first conjunct
  after division by `v̄`.
* For the second conjunct, split `Λ ≤ N⁻¹ ∑ e² 1{|e| ≥ ηR} + η · N⁻¹ ∑ e²` (valid for every
  `η > 0`, since `min(1,u) ≤ η` off `{u ≥ η}`). The second term is `η · (1 + o_P(1))`, so it
  suffices to make the first small; and since `x̄ → μ` in probability and `R_k → ∞`, on the
  event `{|x̄ − μ| ≤ 1}` one has `{|x_l − x̄| ≥ ηR_k} ⊆ {|x_l| ≥ ηR_k − |μ| − 1}` and
  `(x_l − x̄)² ≤ 2x_l² + 2(|μ|+1)²`, so the first term is bounded by a fixed multiple of
  `N⁻¹ ∑_l x_l² 1{|x_l| ≥ K}` for any fixed `K`, once `k` is large. That last quantity
  converges in probability to `(λ ∫_{|t|≥K} t² dP_Y + ∫_{|t|≥K} t² dP_Z)/(1+λ)`, again by
  `tendstoInProb_pooledAvg`, and tends to `0` as `K → ∞` by dominated convergence — this is
  where `MemLp id 2` is used and why no moment beyond `L²` is needed.

The two arithmetic ingredients (`tendstoInProb_pooledAvg` and the dominated-convergence tail)
are both proved in `Randomization/Studentized`; they are *below* this file in the import
graph, so closing this brick means either lifting them here or moving them to a common
`ForMathlib` home. That is bookkeeping, not mathematics. -/

/-! ### The permutation limit

The bivariate statement is reduced to a **scalar** one: the `Asymptotics` converse
`weakConverges_randPairLaw_of_randDist_tendstoInProb` says that convergence in probability of
the (one-permutation) randomization distribution to a limiting c.d.f. already forces the
two-permutation joint law to converge to the *product* — the asymptotic independence is
automatic and needs no separate argument. So the whole content is the scalar core below. -/

/-- **The scalar core of the two-sample permutation limit.** The randomization distribution
of the unstudentized statistic converges in probability to the c.d.f. of `N(0, τ²)`, with the
permutation scale `τ² = λ σ²(P_Y) + σ²(P_Z)`.

STATUS (wave 8): PROVED here, over the single named brick
`tendstoInProb_pooled_hypotheses` above (a pure law-of-large-numbers statement about the
pooled empirical moments, with a fully re-derived route note). The three steps that used to
be the mathematical content are now all discharged:

(1) *The combinatorial central limit theorem*, `ForMathlib/CombinatorialCLT`, is consumed
    through its **moving-threshold** form `tendsto_perm_cdf_blockSum_varying` (proved above),
    because the two-sample threshold `t·mn/(√m·N)` carries the moving sample sizes.
(2) *The identification of the statistic.* `randDist_twoSampleMeanDiff_eq_std` (proved above)
    writes the randomization distribution, exactly and at every finite `k`, as the group
    average of the indicator of a **standardized** permuted block sum of the centred pooled
    data, with threshold `θ_k = t√(n/N)/√v̄` in units of `blockSumScale`; and `θ_k → t/τ`
    because `n/N → 1/(1+λ)` and `v̄ = τ²/(1+λ)`.
(3) *The deterministic-array-to-random-array transfer.* `tendstoInProb_of_deterministic`
    (proved above) is the abstract form of the argument the wave-6 note sketched: it takes
    two nonnegative hypothesis functionals vanishing in probability together with the
    deterministic statement along arbitrary subsequences, and returns convergence in
    probability. No measurable selection is involved, only existence. The `ε`-indexed Hájek
    Lindeberg family is compressed into the single functional `lindebergDefect` by
    `lindeberg_le_lindebergDefect`, which is what makes the transfer applicable.

What is left is therefore only the *in-probability* control of the pooled empirical moments,
isolated in `tendstoInProb_pooled_hypotheses`; see its own note. -/

`Complex.tendsto_one_add_pow_exp_of_tendsto` forces the exponent to be the index itself.
That, together with a varying characteristic-function argument, is supplied here. -/

the mirror image of the permutation variance `τ² = λσ²(P_Y) + σ²(P_Z)`. The two agree if
and only if `λ = 1` or `σ²(P_Y) = σ²(P_Z)`; otherwise the permutation test calibrated on
this unstudentized statistic does not have asymptotic level `α` for testing equality of
means. -/
