# Tests and confidence sets: the duality

Testing a hypothesis for every parameter value at once *is* a confidence statement. If, for
each `θ`, `A θ ⊆ 𝓧` is the acceptance region of a level-`α` test of the simple hypothesis
`H(θ)`, then
$$ S(x) \;=\; \{\theta : x \in A(\theta)\} $$
is a family of confidence sets at confidence level `1 − α`, and conversely every confidence
family arises this way ("test inversion"). Optimality transfers as well: if each `A θ₀` comes
from a test that is uniformly most powerful against the alternatives `K(θ₀)`, then `S`
minimizes the probability of covering each *false* value `θ₀`, uniformly over `θ ∈ K(θ₀)` —
it is **uniformly most accurate**.

This file fixes:

* `confidenceSet A` — the inverted family `S(x) = {θ : x ∈ A θ}`;
* `IsConfidenceFamily P S γ` — coverage at level `γ`, `P_θ{θ ∈ S(X)} ≥ γ` for every `θ`;
* `IsUMAConfidence P K S γ` — uniformly most accurate at level `γ` against `K`;
* `acceptanceTest A` — the nonrandomized test with acceptance region `A`;

and states the two directions of the duality together with the optimality transfer.

**Reference.** Classical confidence-set theory; original sources in the bibliographic comments
below.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* `IsConfidenceFamily` compares in `ℝ≥0∞` (`ENNReal.ofReal γ ≤ P θ {x | θ ∈ S x}`), which
  keeps the definition free of `toReal` side conditions and makes a negative `γ` vacuous
  rather than junk.
* `IsUMAConfidence` quantifies over competitor families whose slices `{x | θ ∈ S' x}` are
  measurable. The restriction is a Lean-side necessity, not a weakening of the classical
  statement: the argument inverts the competitor into a genuine test, and a critical function
  must be measurable. Coverage of a non-measurable family is not a probability statement in
  the first place.
* Tests are the critical functions of the area's data model, so the acceptance region `A`
  enters through the nonrandomized test `acceptanceTest A = 1_{Aᶜ}`; the level condition of
  the book is then `IsLevel P {θ} (acceptanceTest (A θ)) α`, and `power_acceptanceTest`
  converts it into the measure statement `P_θ(A(θ)ᶜ) ≤ α` used in the proofs.
* Only the one-sided framing of the optimality transfer is stated: for each null value `θ₀`
  the competitor class is the tests of `H(θ₀)` against `K(θ₀)`, and the conclusion compares
  false-coverage probabilities at parameter points of `K(θ₀)`. The lower/upper confidence
  *bound* specialization (`S(x)` an interval determined by a monotone family) is a separate
  statement and is not derived here.

**Bibliographic comments.** Confidence sets, the confidence level, and the inversion of tests
are due to J. Neyman ("Outline of a theory of statistical estimation based on the classical
theory of probability," *Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A* **236** (1937), 333–380); the accuracy
criterion and its link with the power of the underlying tests appear there and in
J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson's optimality program ("On the problem of the most efficient tests
of statistical hypotheses," *Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A* **231** (1933), 289–337).
