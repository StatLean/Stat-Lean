# The conditional exponential family engine

A multiparameter exponential family in which one coordinate `θ` is of interest and the
remaining coordinates `ϑ` are nuisance parameters may be reduced to its sufficient statistic
`(U, T)`, whose joint law is again exponential:
$$ dP^{U,T}_{\theta,\vartheta}(u,t) \;=\; C(\theta,\vartheta)\,
   \exp\bigl(\theta u + \langle \vartheta, t\rangle\bigr)\, d\nu(u,t). $$
This is `IsCanonicalUT`. The engine of the multiparameter theory is the observation that
**conditionally on `T = t`** this collapses to a *one-parameter* exponential family in `θ`,
$$ dP^{U\mid t}_{\theta}(u) \;=\; C_t(\theta)\, e^{\theta u}\, d\nu_t(u), $$
whose base measure `ν_t` depends only on `t` and whose normalizer `C_t(θ)` depends only on
`(t, θ)`: **the nuisance parameter `ϑ` has disappeared**. Every conditional test built on this
family therefore has a `ϑ`-free conditional size, and the one-parameter optimality theory
applies surface by surface.

conditioning on `T`). (`TSH4 §4.4 Lem 4.4.1`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The conditional law is Mathlib's `condDistrib U T (P p)`, a Markov kernel `Ξ ⇝ ℝ`
  determined up to `((P p).map T)`-null sets; every conclusion below is therefore stated
  almost everywhere with respect to the law of `T`. Since all members of an exponential
  family with a common base measure are mutually absolutely continuous, the null sets do
  not depend on the parameter, so "a.e. `t`" is unambiguous across the family.
* The tilting computation behind `condDistrib_expFamily_of_isCanonicalUT` — the conditional
  distribution of a `withDensity`-tilted joint law on a standard Borel space is the tilt of
  the conditional distribution — is the sibling-drafted brick
  `StatLean/HypothesisTesting/ForMathlib/CondDistribTilt.lean`; the existential produced
  here (`νt`, `Ct`) is meant to be read off from that brick applied to the joint density
  `exp(θu + ⟪ϑ,t⟫)`, in which the `ϑ`-dependent factor `exp⟪ϑ,t⟫` is `u`-free and hence
  cancels between numerator and normalizer.
* **Signature amendment.** `condDistrib_expFamily_of_isCanonicalUT` and
  `condDistrib_eq_of_fst_eq` carry an added instance `[OpensMeasurableSpace Ξ]`: without it
  the σ-algebra of `Ξ` is unrelated to its topology, the canonical density need not be
  measurable, and neither `withDensity_mul` nor the tilt engine applies. It is documented at
  each theorem; `[SecondCountableTopology Ξ]` is *not* needed.
* `IsCanonicalUT` is a predicate on a supplied family rather than a bundled structure, so
  that a model may be presented in any parametrization and identified with the canonical
  form only on the parameter set `Ω` actually used. Off `Ω` it says nothing.
* No positivity or σ-finiteness is imposed on the base measures in the statement: they are
  consequences of the canonical form on standard Borel spaces and belong in the proof, not
  the signature.

**Bibliographic comments.** Conditioning on a sufficient statistic to eliminate nuisance
parameters is due to J. Neyman ("Outline of a theory of statistical estimation based on the
classical theory of probability," *Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A* **236** (1937), 333–380) and
J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson ("Contributions to the theory of testing statistical
hypotheses," *Statistical Research Memoirs* **1** (1936), 1–37); the completeness theory
that makes the reduction lossless is due to E. L. Lehmann and H. Scheffé ("Completeness,
similar regions, and unbiased estimation," *Sankhyā* **10** (1950), 305–340; **15** (1955),
219–236).

/-- **Canonical `(U, T)` exponential family.**

The joint law of the sufficient statistic `(U, T)` under the parameter `(θ, ϑ) ∈ Ω` has
density `C(θ,ϑ)·exp(θ·u + ⟪ϑ, t⟫)` with respect to a fixed parameter-free measure `ν` on
the range of `(U, T)`. Here `U` carries the parameter of interest `θ` and `T` carries the
nuisance parameters `ϑ`.

Edge behaviour: the condition is imposed only for parameters in `Ω`; members of `P` outside
`Ω` are unconstrained. -/

/-- **The conditional law of `U` given `T = t` is a one-parameter exponential family.**

For a canonical `(U, T)` family there are a base measure `ν_t` on the line depending only on
`t` and normalizers `C_t(θ)` depending only on `(t, θ)` — in particular **not** on the
nuisance parameter `ϑ` — such that, for every parameter in `Ω` and almost every `t`,
`dP^{U|t}_θ(u) = C_t(θ)·e^{θu}·dν_t(u)`.

This is the reduction that makes the whole multiparameter theory one-parameter: the
conditional problem given `T = t` is a one-parameter exponential family in `θ` with natural
statistic `u`.

**FLAGGED SIGNATURE AMENDMENT.** The instance `[OpensMeasurableSpace Ξ]` was *added* to the
frozen statement. It is the exact hypothesis making the nuisance factor `t ↦ ⟪ϑ, t⟫` — hence
the canonical density `z ↦ C(p)·exp(θ z.1 + ⟪ϑ, z.2⟫)` itself — measurable, which every step
of the proof consumes: `withDensity_mul` (to rewrite the joint law of `(U,T)` at `p` as a
product-form tilt of the joint law at a reference parameter `p₀`) and
`condDistrib_fst_withDensity_tilt` (to cancel the nuisance factor from the conditional law)
both require measurable factors. Without it the frozen `[MeasurableSpace Ξ]` is unrelated to
the topology of `Ξ` and the density appearing in `IsCanonicalUT` need not be measurable, so
`Measure.withDensity` silently replaces it by its largest measurable minorant. That does not
make the conclusion false — it tends to make the *hypothesis* degenerate instead: e.g. for
`Ξ = ℝ` with the trivial σ-algebra the largest measurable minorant of
`exp(θu + ϑt)` over each atom `ℝ × ℝ` is `0` whenever `ϑ ≠ 0`, so `IsCanonicalUT` forces
`ϑ = 0` for every `p ∈ Ω` and the family is measurable after all — but no route is known that
proves the statement without a measurable density. Every intended instantiation
(`Ξ = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)`) satisfies the instance. `[SecondCountableTopology Ξ]` is
*not* needed: the argument never compares `borel (ℝ × Ξ)` with the product σ-algebra. -/

/-- **The conditional law does not depend on the nuisance parameter.**

Two parameters of `Ω` sharing the same coordinate of interest `θ` induce the same
conditional distribution of `U` given `T = t`, for almost every `t`. Immediate from
`condDistrib_expFamily_of_isCanonicalUT`, since the right-hand side there mentions the
parameter only through `p.1`.

The proof does not go through that theorem but through the same engine specialised to a
*pure nuisance* tilt: when `p.1 = q.1` the joint law at `p` is the joint law at `q`
reweighted by the `u`-free factor `k(t) = (C p / C q)·exp⟪ϑp − ϑq, t⟫`, i.e. the case
`g ≡ 1` of `condDistrib_fst_withDensity_tilt`, whose conditional normaliser is `1`. This
keeps the conclusion on the `p`-marginal of `T`, which is the filter asked for, and avoids
transporting an almost-everywhere statement across the two marginals.

**FLAGGED SIGNATURE AMENDMENT.** `[OpensMeasurableSpace Ξ]` was added, for the same reason
as in `condDistrib_expFamily_of_isCanonicalUT`; see that docstring. -/

/-- **Overall power is the average of conditional powers.**

For a test `φ` of the sufficient statistic, the power against `P_{θ,ϑ}` is obtained by
averaging the conditional power on each surface `T = t` over the law of `T`:
`E_{θ,ϑ}[φ(U,T)] = ∫ (∫ φ(u,t) dP^{U|t}_θ(u)) dP^T_{θ,ϑ}(t)`.

This is the identity by which maximizing the conditional power surface by surface maximizes
the unconditional power; it is a disintegration statement and needs no exponential-family
