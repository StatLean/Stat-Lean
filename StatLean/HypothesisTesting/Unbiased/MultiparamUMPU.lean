# UMP unbiased tests for multiparameter exponential families

For a canonical `(U, T)` exponential family
`dP^{U,T}_{θ,ϑ}(u,t) = C(θ,ϑ)·exp(θu + ⟪ϑ,t⟫)·dν(u,t)` on a convex parameter set `Ω` that is
not contained in a proper linear subspace, the four testing problems about the parameter of
interest `θ` (the nuisance parameters `ϑ` being unspecified),

| null | alternative | test |
|---|---|---|
| `θ ≤ θ₀` | `θ > θ₀` | reject for large `u` |
| `θ ≤ θ₁` or `θ ≥ θ₂` | `θ₁ < θ < θ₂` | reject *inside* an interval in `u` |
| `θ₁ ≤ θ ≤ θ₂` | `θ < θ₁` or `θ > θ₂` | reject *outside* an interval in `u` |
| `θ = θ₀` | `θ ≠ θ₀` | reject *outside* an interval in `u` |

all admit UMP unbiased level-`α` tests, obtained by solving the corresponding one-parameter
problem **conditionally on `T = t`** and reinterpreting the result as a test of `(U, T)`.
The names `_inside` / `_outside` refer to the shape of the rejection region in `u`, not to
the shape of the null set.

**⚠ The four optimality theorems were FALSE in the frozen form transcribed here**, for two
independent reasons, and all four have been **REPAIRED**.

1. *The transcription dropped the source's standing convention that the observation is the
   sufficient statistic.* `IsCanonicalUT` constrains only the law of the pair `(U, T)`, while
   `IsUMPU` quantifies over all critical functions of the sample space; taking `U` and `T`
   constant makes the hypotheses vacuous and the conclusion false. Explicit counterexamples
   are formalized in the section `ConditionalUMPUCounterexample` below, one per theorem. The
   repair is the added hypothesis `hsuff : SufficiencyReducible P Ω U T`; the counterexamples
   are retained because they are what certifies that it is not decoration.
2. *The non-degeneracy hypothesis was mis-transcribed.* The source's "`Ω` is not contained in
   a linear space of dimension less than `k+1`" means an *affine* flat; the frozen
   `Submodule.span ℝ Ω = ⊤` is strictly weaker and does not suffice. For `Ξ = ℝ` the convex
   set `Ω = {(θ, 1 − θ) : θ ∈ [-1,1]}` has full linear span and reaches strictly below and
   above `θ₀ = 0`, yet its boundary surface `{p ∈ Ω | p.1 = 0}` is a *single point*, so the
   boundary family of laws of `T` is a one-element family and carries no completeness — the
   step from similarity to Neyman structure collapses. The repair is the added hypothesis
   `hΩ_aff : affineSpan ℝ Ω = ⊤` (see `boundedlyComplete_boundary`).

The two remaining amendments are the instances `[BorelSpace Ξ] [FiniteDimensional ℝ Ξ]`: the
first is what makes the canonical exponent measurable, the second is what turns
`hΩ_aff` into nonempty interior and hence makes the boundary slice `k`-dimensional.

**Status.** `isUMPU_conditional_oneSided`, `_inside` and `_outside` are **PROVED**, with no
lifted brick left: `boundedlyComplete_boundary` (bounded completeness of the laws of `T` over
a boundary surface — the Lehmann–Scheffé input) is now proved here, by writing every boundary
law of `T` as an exponential tilt of the law at one interior boundary parameter and applying
Laplace-transform uniqueness through the isometry
`Ξ ≃ₗᵢ[ℝ] EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (finrank ℝ Ξ))`. `isUMPU_conditional_point` additionally needs
the *derivative* side condition for a competitor, and is documented at the theorem.

The machinery is elementary and self-contained: conditionally on `T = t` all members of the
family are exponential tilts of one another (`ae_condDistrib_expTilt`), and every optimality
statement is the variation-diminishing inequality `∫ g·(k e^{cu} − k e^{cC}) ≥ 0` for a `g`
changing sign at the critical value (`integral_expTilt_signed`, and its two-threshold
companion `integral_expTilt_signed_interval` built from the three-exponential separation).
Continuity of the power function along segments of `Ω` — proved here from convexity alone,
by the two-point envelope `e^{(1−s)a+sb} ≤ e^a + e^b` — is what upgrades the level inequality
at a boundary parameter to similarity.

The constants are functions of `t`, determined by conditional size equations; the point-null
case carries in addition the conditional derivative condition
`E_{θ₀}[U·φ ∣ t] = α·E_{θ₀}[U ∣ t]`, which is what unbiasedness contributes and which may
not be dropped.

Contents:

  functions, as functions of `(u, t)`;

  theorems;

  `integral_comp_sign_of_condZero_interval` — the conditional-to-unconditional engines;

  the power along segments of `Ω`, and the similarity it yields at a boundary parameter;

**Proof formalization notes.**
* "The parameter set is not contained in a linear space of dimension less than `k+1`" is
  transcribed as `Submodule.span ℝ Ω = ⊤` in the ambient `ℝ × Ξ`: for a `k`-dimensional
  nuisance space `Ξ` the ambient dimension is `k+1`, so spanning the ambient space is
  exactly the stated non-degeneracy. Together with convexity it is what makes each boundary
  slice `ω_j = {(θ,ϑ) ∈ Ω : θ = θ_j}` contain a `k`-dimensional rectangle, hence makes the
  family of laws of `T` on `ω_j` complete — the input that upgrades similarity to Neyman
  structure.
* The conditional size conditions are imposed for **almost every** `t` rather than for every
  `t`. This is the weaker hypothesis (hence the stronger theorem), it is all the averaging
  identity `integral_eq_integral_condDistrib` consumes, and it is what the measurable
  selection actually delivers, since the conditional distributions themselves are only
  determined up to null sets.
* The size conditions are imposed at *every* parameter of `Ω` whose coordinate of interest
  equals the relevant `θ_j`; by `condDistrib_eq_of_fst_eq` this is no stronger than
  imposing them at one such parameter, but stating it this way keeps the theorems
  independent of that derivation.
* The constants `C(·)`, `γ(·)` and their defining equations are *data*: they are supplied by
  the caller and their existence is the separate theorem
  `exists_measurable_conditional_constants`.
* Only members of `P` with parameter in `Ω` are evaluated: both the null and the alternative
  sets in the conclusions are subsets of `Ω`.

critical value `C₀(t)`, randomize with probability `γ₀(t)` when `u = C₀(t)`.

Edge behaviour: the value at `u = C₀(t)` is `γ₀(t)` regardless of whether `γ₀ t ∈ [0,1]`;
the membership is a hypothesis of the theorems, not of the definition. -/

/-- **Inside-interval conditional test**: on the surface `T = t`, reject when `u` lies
strictly between `C₁(t)` and `C₂(t)`, randomizing at the two endpoints.

Edge behaviour: if `C₁ t = C₂ t` the lower randomization value `γ₁ t` takes precedence. -/

    else if z.1 = C₂ z.2 then γ₂ z.2 else 0

/-- **Outside-interval conditional test**: on the surface `T = t`, reject when `u` lies
outside `[C₁(t), C₂(t)]`, randomizing at the two endpoints.

Edge behaviour: if `C₁ t = C₂ t` the lower randomization value `γ₁ t` takes precedence. -/

    else if z.1 = C₁ z.2 then γ₁ z.2
    else if z.1 = C₂ z.2 then γ₂ z.2 else 0

/-! ## The sufficiency-reduction hypothesis (the repair) -/

/-- **Sufficiency of `(U, T)`, in the form the optimality theorems consume.** Every critical
function on the sample space is matched, *in power at every parameter of `Ω`*, by a critical
function of the pair `(U, T)` alone.

This is the operative content of "`(U, T)` is a sufficient statistic for `P` on `Ω`": the
Rao–Blackwellization `ψ' = E[ψ ∣ U, T]` is parameter-free by sufficiency, is again a critical
function, and has the same power as `ψ` at every parameter. It holds trivially — with
`ψ' = ψ` — in the source's setting, where the sample space *is* the range of `(U, T)`
(`sufficiencyReducible_prod`), and it fails in the counterexample family below, where
`(U, T)` is constant. -/
def SufficiencyReducible (P : ℝ × Ξ → Measure 𝓧) (Ω : Set (ℝ × Ξ)) (U : 𝓧 → ℝ) (T : 𝓧 → Ξ) :
    Prop :=
  ∀ ψ : 𝓧 → ℝ, IsCriticalFn ψ → ∃ ψ' : ℝ × Ξ → ℝ, IsCriticalFn ψ' ∧
    ∀ p ∈ Ω, ∫ x, ψ' (U x, T x) ∂(P p) = ∫ x, ψ x ∂(P p)

/-- **In the source's setting the reduction hypothesis is vacuous.** When the sample space is
the range `ℝ × Ξ` of the sufficient statistic and `(U, T) = (Prod.fst, Prod.snd)`, every
critical function already *is* a function of `(U, T)`. So the amended theorems specialize to
exactly the statement of `TSH4 §4.4 Thm 4.4.1`. -/
theorem sufficiencyReducible_prod (P : ℝ × Ξ → Measure (ℝ × Ξ)) (Ω : Set (ℝ × Ξ)) :
    SufficiencyReducible P Ω Prod.fst Prod.snd :=
  fun ψ hψ => ⟨ψ, hψ, fun _ _ => rfl⟩

/-! ## ⚠ The four optimality statements are FALSE as stated: an explicit counterexample

`IsCanonicalUT P Ω U T ν C` constrains **only the law of the pair `(U, T)`**; it says nothing
about the rest of the sample space `𝓧`. `IsUMPU`, on the other hand, demands optimality
against *every* critical function on `𝓧`. So as soon as `𝓧` carries information about the
parameter of interest that `(U, T)` does not see, a test built from `(U, T)` alone loses.
Taking `U` and `T` **constant** makes `IsCanonicalUT` hold vacuously (with `ν` a Dirac mass
and `C ≡ 1`) while leaving `P` completely free, which is the counterexample below:

* `𝓧 = Bool`, `Ξ = ℝ`, `U ≡ 0`, `T ≡ 0`, `ν = δ₍₀,₀₎`, `C ≡ 1`, `Ω = univ`, `α = 1/2`;
* `P p =` the Dirac mass at `true` when `p` is in the alternative set, the fair coin
  otherwise;
* the conditional test with `C₀ ≡ 0` and boundary weight `γ₀ ≡ 1/2` is the **constant**
  `1/2`, and its conditional size is `1/2 = α` on every surface, so all hypotheses hold;
* but `ψ = 1{bit = true}` is a critical function, unbiased at level `1/2` (power `1/2` on the
  null set, power `1` on the alternative), and strictly beats the conditional test.

The construction is uniform in the alternative set, so the *same* family refutes all four
theorems (`_oneSided`, `_inside`, `_outside`, `_point`); the four refutations are
`not_isUMPU_conditional_oneSided_counterexample` and its siblings below.

**REPAIR (APPLIED).** The source (TSH4 §4.4 Thm 4.4.1) states the theorem for the model *of
the sufficient statistic*: there `𝓧` **is** the range of `(U, T)`. Rather than specialize the
type — which would prevent the theorems from being applied to a model carried on its own
sample space — the four statements now carry the single extra hypothesis
`SufficiencyReducible P Ω U T`: every critical function on `𝓧` is matched, *in power at every
parameter of `Ω`*, by a critical function of `(U, T)` alone. This is exactly the operative
content of "`(U, T)` is sufficient for `P` on `Ω`" (Rao–Blackwellize: `E[ψ ∣ U, T]` does not
depend on the parameter and has the same power at every parameter), and it holds trivially,
with `ψ' = ψ`, in the source's setting `𝓧 = ℝ × Ξ`, `U = Prod.fst`, `T = Prod.snd`
(`sufficiencyReducible_prod`). It fails in the counterexample family, where `(U, T)` is
constant and the auxiliary bit of `𝓧` is invisible to it — which is what makes the
counterexample a counterexample.

A second, independent defect of the frozen statements — the mis-transcribed non-degeneracy
hypothesis — is described in the file docstring and at `boundedlyComplete_boundary`; it is
repaired by the added `hΩ_aff : affineSpan ℝ Ω = ⊤`.

After both repairs, `_oneSided`, `_inside` and `_outside` are proved. Contrary to what an
earlier draft of this file recorded, the boundary device needs neither
`PowerContinuity.continuous_power_expFamily` nor `Ω ⊆ interior natSet`: continuity of the
power along a segment of `Ω` follows from convexity of `Ω` alone, by the two-point envelope
(`tendsto_integral_canonical_segment`). Completeness of the laws of `T` on a boundary slice is
`boundedlyComplete_boundary`, proved here. What remains is — for the point null only — the
derivative side condition, documented at `isUMPU_conditional_point`.

/-! ## Fibrewise toolkit: exponential tilts on the conditional line

Conditionally on `T = t` all members of a canonical `(U, T)` family are exponential tilts of
one another: by `ConditionalExpFamily.condDistrib_expFamily_of_isCanonicalUT` the conditional
law at `(θ, ϑ)` is `(νt t).withDensity (u ↦ Ct t θ · e^{θu})`, so the law at `θ` is the law at
`θ₀` tilted by `k·e^{(θ−θ₀)u}` with `k = Ct t θ / Ct t θ₀`. Everything the four theorems need
about the fibres is the elementary "variation-diminishing" inequality below, applied to
`g = φ − ψ` (optimality) or to `g = φ − α` (level and unbiasedness). -/

/-! ## Global toolkit: the canonical `(U, T)` family on its own scale

The canonical hypothesis `IsCanonicalUT` identifies the law of `(U, T)` with a `ν`-density.
Everything below is read off from that identification: the normalizing constant is strictly
positive, the laws of `(U, T)` — hence of `T` — are mutually equivalent across `Ω`, and the
power of a test of `(U, T)` is a ratio of two `ν`-integrals which is continuous along segments
of `Ω`, by the two-point envelope `e^{(1−s)a+sb} ≤ e^a + e^b`. -/

/-- **Tilt transfer of integrability between two boundary laws of `T`.** If `f` is integrable
for the law of `T` at `(θ₀, ϑ)`, then `f · e^{⟪ϑ − ϑ₁, ·⟫}` is integrable for the law of `T`
at `(θ₀, ϑ₁)` — the two boundary laws differ exactly by that exponential tilt.

This is the step that removes the boundedness hypothesis from `boundedlyComplete_boundary`:
that proof used `|f| ≤ Cb` for one purpose only, namely to dominate the tilted integrand, and
the domination is unnecessary once the integrability is *transported* rather than re-proved.
The route is `integrable_comp_UT_iff` downwards at `(θ₀, ϑ)`, the pointwise identity
`e^{canExp (θ₀,ϑ) z} = e^{⟪ϑ − ϑ₁, z.2⟫}·e^{canExp (θ₀,ϑ₁) z}` (the `u`-part of the canonical
exponent is the same at both parameters because they share the first coordinate), and
`integrable_comp_UT_iff` upwards at `(θ₀, ϑ₁)`. -/

/-- **Bounded completeness of the boundary family.**

The laws of `T` over a boundary surface `ω = {p ∈ Ω | p.1 = θ₀}` are boundedly complete.

This is the Lehmann–Scheffé input of `TSH4 §4.4 Thm 4.4.1`. The source derives it from
convexity of `Ω` together with the non-degeneracy "`Ω` is not contained in a linear space of
dimension less than `k+1`": with parameters of `Ω` strictly on both sides of `θ₀`, those force
the slice `{ϑ | (θ₀, ϑ) ∈ Ω}` to have nonempty interior in `Ξ` (`interior_slice_nonempty`); on
that slice the laws of `T` form a canonical exponential family in `ϑ`, so Laplace-transform
uniqueness gives completeness.

**Proof.** The base measure `ν` of `IsCanonicalUT` is not assumed σ-finite, and its `Ξ`-margin
need not be either, so the exponential family is *not* set up against a `ϑ`-free base measure
here. Instead, one interior boundary parameter `ϑ₁` is fixed and every other boundary law of
`T` is written as the `(ϑ − ϑ₁)`-exponential tilt of the probability measure
`μ₁ = (P (θ₀, ϑ₁)).map T` — an identity read off `integral_comp_UT_eq` on both sides, the
`u`-integration cancelling because the tilting factor depends on `z` only through `z.2`. That
makes the reference measure a probability measure, hence σ-finite, and the vanishing
hypothesis becomes the vanishing of the Laplace transform of `f` against `μ₁` on the
translated slice `S − ϑ₁`, which has `0` in its interior. Transporting along the isometry
`(stdOrthonormalBasis ℝ Ξ).repr : Ξ ≃ₗᵢ[ℝ] EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin (finrank ℝ Ξ))` — inner
products, and therefore the whole Laplace transform, are preserved — puts the statement in
the form of `PointEstimation.ae_eq_zero_of_integral_exp_inner_eq_zero`. Mutual equivalence of
the boundary laws (`statLaw_ac`) then carries `f =ᵐ[μ₁] 0` to every boundary parameter.

**Two flagged amendments, both indispensable.**
* `[FiniteDimensional ℝ Ξ]`: an infinite-dimensional convex set can have full span, or full
  affine span, without having any interior point, and then the slice family need not be
  complete.
* `hΩ_aff : affineSpan ℝ Ω = ⊤` — and **not** the frozen `Submodule.span ℝ Ω = ⊤`, which is
  strictly weaker and does **not** suffice. Degenerate example: `Ξ = ℝ`,
  `Ω = {(θ, 1 − θ) : θ ∈ [-1, 1]}` is convex, has `Submodule.span ℝ Ω = ⊤` (it contains
  `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`) and reaches strictly below and above `θ₀ = 0`, yet its boundary
  surface `{p ∈ Ω | p.1 = 0}` is the single point `(0,1)`, so the boundary family of laws of
  `T` is a *one-element* family and is not complete. `affineSpan ℝ Ω = ⊤` is the faithful
  reading of the source's "not contained in a linear space of dimension less than `k+1`"
  ("linear space" = affine flat), and in finite dimension it is exactly what makes the
  boundary slice `k`-dimensional.

**Unbounded, not just boundedly, complete.** `f` is only required to be measurable and
*integrable* for each boundary law — not bounded. This matters: the derivative side condition
of the point null, `E_{θ₀}[Uψ ∣ t] = α·E_{θ₀}[U ∣ t]`, tests a function of `t` built from the
unbounded `U`, so `IsBoundedlyCompleteFamily` is too weak for it. The upstream
`PointEstimation.ae_eq_zero_of_integral_exp_inner_eq_zero` was always stated for arbitrary
measurable `f`; the only place the old proof used a bound `|f| ≤ Cb` was to dominate the
tilted integrand `f · e^{⟪ϑ − ϑ₁, ·⟫}` against `μ₁`, and that integrability is *transported*
from the law at `(θ₀, ϑ)` by `integrable_statLaw_tilt` instead. `boundedlyComplete_boundary`
below is the bounded corollary, and is what the three other optimality theorems consume.

**The hypotheses are only asked at parameters interior to `Ω`.** `hfint`/`hfzero` quantify
over `(θ₀, ϑ) ∈ interior Ω`, not over the whole boundary slice, and the reference parameter
`ϑ₁` is taken from `exists_interior_boundary_point` rather than from
`interior_slice_nonempty`. Nothing is lost — the slice `S'` of admissible tilt directions is
then literally *open*, so `interior S' = S' ∋ 0` and the Laplace-uniqueness input applies
verbatim, while the conclusion is still `f =ᵐ 0` for **every** `p ∈ Ω` because the laws of
`T` are mutually equivalent (`statLaw_ac`). This weakening is what makes the lemma usable at
`isUMPU_conditional_point`: the derivative side condition is only available where a *pure-`θ`
window* `(θ₀ ± η, ϑ)` fits inside `Ω`, which for a general convex `Ω` holds at interior
points of the surface but can fail at boundary points of it (e.g. at the apex of a triangle
whose base straddles `θ₀`). -/

The point-null optimality argument needs, beyond the interval machinery above, a separation
by an *affine* function (rather than by a three-exponential combination) and an exponential
majorant for `|u|`. Both are proved here; what is still missing is recorded at
`isUMPU_conditional_point`. -/

/-- **Secant separation.** For `C₁ < C₂` there is an affine function `A + B u` which meets
`exp (c u)` at `C₁` and at `C₂`, lies above it inside the interval and below it outside.

This is the separation the *point* null needs, and it is the exact analogue of the
three-exponential separations `exists_sep_exp3_gt` / `exists_sep_exp3_lt` used for the
interval nulls: with `g = φ − ψ` — the difference of the outside-interval test and a
competitor — one gets `g(u)·(exp (c u) − A − B u) ≥ 0` for every `u`, because `g ≥ 0`
outside `[C₁, C₂]` and `g ≤ 0` inside, and the two side conditions of the point null
(`∫ g dκ = 0` and `∫ u g(u) dκ = 0`) annihilate the two affine terms `A` and `B u`.

The two endpoint equalities are what makes the interval closed on both sides: they let the
boundary atoms be assigned to either side without changing the integral. -/

/-- **Two-point exponential majorant for `|u|`.** For every `δ > 0`,
`|u| ≤ δ⁻¹ (e^{δu} + e^{−δu})`.

This is what makes `u` conditionally integrable under every member of a canonical family
that reaches strictly below and strictly above a given parameter: the two tilts by `±δ` are
probability measures, so their densities are integrable, and the majorant transfers that to
`|u|`. It is the missing integrability input of item (c) at

/-- **Differentiation of the canonical `ν`-integral in the natural parameter `θ`.** For a
bounded measurable `g` and a nuisance coordinate `ϑ₀` at which the pure-`θ` segment
`(θ₀ ± η, ϑ₀)` lies in `Ω`,

`d/dθ ∫ g(z) e^{θ z₁ + ⟪ϑ₀, z₂⟫} dν(z) ∣_{θ₀} = ∫ g(z) z₁ e^{θ₀ z₁ + ⟪ϑ₀, z₂⟫} dν(z)`,

and the right-hand integrand is `ν`-integrable.

This is the analytic half of item (b) at `isUMPU_conditional_point`. It is stated at the
level of the base measure `ν` rather than of the power, because that is what makes it usable
*twice* — at the competitor `ψ` and at `g ≡ 1` — which is what eliminates the normalizer: the
power is `C(θ,ϑ₀)·∫ψ e^{canExp}` and only the *product* is pinned down by `IsCanonicalUT`, but
`C(θ,ϑ₀)·∫1·e^{canExp} = 1` (`integrable_canExp`), so the power is the ratio
`(∫ψ e^{canExp})/(∫ e^{canExp})` of two functions this lemma differentiates, and the quotient
rule finishes without ever differentiating `C` directly.

**The dominating function.** For `|θ − θ₀| ≤ η/2` the derivative integrand is majorised,
independently of `θ`, by a fixed combination of three *members of the family*:

`|g z · z₁ · e^{θ z₁ + c}| ≤ (2/η)·(e^{(θ₀+η)z₁+c} + 2e^{θ₀z₁+c} + e^{(θ₀−η)z₁+c})`.

Two factors of the two-point majorant `abs_le_exp_add_exp_neg` at half-width `η/2` produce
it: one absorbs `|z₁|`, the other absorbs the drift `e^{(θ−θ₀)z₁}`, and their product
telescopes because `e^{(η/2)z₁}·e^{−(η/2)z₁} = 1`. Each of the three terms is `ν`-integrable
by `integrable_canExp`, precisely because `(θ₀ ± η, ϑ₀)` and `(θ₀, ϑ₀)` are all in `Ω` — which
is what `exists_twoSided_boundary_pair` (via `exists_interior_boundary_point`) supplies. -/

/-- **The derivative side condition, at the level of the full measure.** If a bounded
measurable test `ψ` of `(U, T)` has power exactly `α` at the boundary parameter `(θ₀, ϑ₀)` and
power at least `α` all along the pure-`θ` segment `(θ₀ ± η, ϑ₀) ⊆ Ω`, then

`E_{(θ₀,ϑ₀)}[U·ψ] = α · E_{(θ₀,ϑ₀)}[U]`.

This is item (b) of `isUMPU_conditional_point` in full: it is the analytic content of
unbiasedness, namely that the power function of the conditional problem has a *minimum* at
`θ₀` and therefore a vanishing derivative there.

**Why no normalizer has to be differentiated.** `integrable_canExp` gives
`C(θ,ϑ₀)·∫e^{canExp (θ,ϑ₀)} dν = 1`, so along the segment the power is the ratio
`N(θ)/D(θ)` with `N(θ) = ∫ψ e^{canExp (θ,ϑ₀)} dν` and `D(θ) = ∫e^{canExp (θ,ϑ₀)} dν` — both
differentiated by `hasDerivAt_integral_canExp` (at `g := ψ` and at `g := 1`), and `C` never
appears. `HasDerivAt.div` plus `IsLocalMin.hasDerivAt_eq_zero` give `N'(θ₀)D(θ₀) =
N(θ₀)D'(θ₀)`, and `integral_comp_UT_eq` reads `C·N'(θ₀) = E[Uψ]`, `C·D'(θ₀) = E[U]`,
`N(θ₀)/D(θ₀) = α` off it. -/

/-- **Two-point envelope for the derivative along a canonical segment.** For the affine
exponent `L(s) = (1−s)a + sb` and a half-width `η > 0`,
`|b − a|·e^{L(s)} ≤ η⁻¹(e^{L(s−η)} + e^{L(s+η)})`.

The left-hand side is `|d/ds e^{L(s)}|`, and the two exponentials on the right are the
values of the *same* exponent at the two shifted segment parameters — that is, densities of
two members of the canonical family. So this is the dominating function that differentiation
under the integral sign needs at item (b) of `isUMPU_conditional_point`: on
`[s₀ − η, s₀ + η]` the `s`-derivative of the integrand is dominated by a fixed integrable
function, uniformly in `s`. It is the exact analogue, one derivative up, of
`exp_segment_le`, and it rests on the same two-point majorant `abs_le_exp_add_exp_neg` that
supplies the conditional integrability of `U` in item (c). -/

/-- **A two-sided pair of boundary parameters on a common nuisance coordinate.** Under the
amendments `hΩ_aff` and `[FiniteDimensional ℝ Ξ]` the surface `θ = θ₀` meets the *interior*
of `Ω` (`exists_interior_boundary_point`), so a whole ball around such a point lies in `Ω`.
In particular there is a `δ > 0` for which all three of `(θ₀, ϑ₀)`, `(θ₀ − δ, ϑ₀)` and
`(θ₀ + δ, ϑ₀)` are in `Ω`, with the **same** nuisance coordinate `ϑ₀`.

This is exactly what `hΩ_lt`/`hΩ_gt` alone fail to give: those hypotheses produce two
parameters straddling `θ₀`, but on unrelated nuisance coordinates, whereas
`ae_condDistrib_expTilt` compares two conditional laws by a tilt in the *`θ`*-direction only
when the nuisance coordinate is held fixed. Moving the two straddling parameters onto a
common `ϑ₀` is the step that threads item (a) into item (c) at `isUMPU_conditional_point`. -/

/-- **Conditional integrability of `U` on the boundary surface.** At the boundary parameter
`w = (θ₀, ϑ₀)` produced by `exists_twoSided_boundary_pair`, the identity `u ↦ u` is
`condDistrib U T (P w) t`-integrable for `(P w).map T`-almost every `t`.

Mechanism. The two neighbours `(θ₀ ± δ, ϑ₀)` share the nuisance coordinate of `w`, so
`ae_condDistrib_expTilt` presents their conditional laws as the `(±δ)`-tilts of
`κ_t = condDistrib U T (P w) t` — a tilt in the `θ`-direction, which is what makes the
exponents `±δ·u` rather than an inner product against a nuisance increment. Both tilts are
probability measures, so `integrable_expTiltDensity` makes `u ↦ e^{δu}` and `u ↦ e^{−δu}`
both `κ_t`-integrable, and `abs_le_exp_add_exp_neg` majorises `|u|` by `δ⁻¹` times their sum.
The a.e.-`t` bookkeeping is the transport of the two tilt statements — each stated a.e. for
the law of `T` at its *own* parameter — back to `(P w).map T`, which is `statLaw_ac`.

This is the conditional-integrability input of item (c) at `isUMPU_conditional_point`. -/

  --      together with integrability of the derivative integrand, by
  --      `hasDerivAt_integral_of_dominated_loc_of_deriv_le` over the uniform majorant
  --        `|g z · z₁ · e^{θz₁+c}| ≤ (2/η)(e^{(θ₀+η)z₁+c} + 2e^{θ₀z₁+c} + e^{(θ₀−η)z₁+c})`
  --      for `|θ − θ₀| ≤ η/2` — two applications of `abs_le_exp_add_exp_neg` at half-width
  --      `η/2`, one absorbing `|z₁|` and one the drift `e^{(θ−θ₀)z₁}`, their product
  --      telescoping because `e^{(η/2)z₁}·e^{−(η/2)z₁} = 1`. Each of the three terms is

  --
  --      *The previous note's "differentiation of the normalizer" worry is RESOLVED, not
  --      outstanding.* It claimed `θ ↦ C(θ,ϑ₀)` needs a separate exponential-family
  --      smoothness theorem. It does not: `integrable_canExp` gives
  --      `C(θ,ϑ₀)·∫ e^{canExp (θ,ϑ₀)} dν = 1` for every `θ` with `(θ,ϑ₀) ∈ Ω`, so
  --      `C(θ,ϑ₀) = (∫ e^{canExp (θ,ϑ₀)} dν)⁻¹` and the power
  --      `θ ↦ ∫ψ dP_{(θ,ϑ₀)} = C(θ,ϑ₀)·∫ψ e^{canExp}` is the *ratio*
  --      `(∫ψ e^{canExp})/(∫ e^{canExp})` of two functions `hasDerivAt_integral_canExp`
  --      differentiates (at `g := ψ` and at `g := 1`). The quotient rule then differentiates
  --      the power without ever touching `C` directly. That is exactly why the lemma is
  --      stated at the level of `ν` rather than of the power.
  --
  --      That assembly is DONE too: `integral_U_mul_eq_of_boundary_min` above packages
  --      `HasDerivAt.div` on the ratio, the observation that unbiasedness makes
  --      `θ ↦ ∫ψ dP_{(θ,ϑ₀)}` have a local minimum at `θ₀` (it equals `α` there by
  --      similarity and is `≥ α` off the null) so `IsLocalMin.hasDerivAt_eq_zero` kills the
  --      derivative, and the reading of the resulting identity through
  --      `integral_comp_UT_eq` as `E_{(θ₀,ϑ₀)}[Uψ] = α·E_{(θ₀,ϑ₀)}[U]`. So (b) is CLOSED.
  --  (c) DONE (this session). The conditional-integrability half was closed in wave 6
  --      (`exists_boundary_ae_integrable_id`, threading item (a) through
  --      `exists_twoSided_boundary_pair`), and the completeness half — `IsCompleteFamily`
  --      rather than `IsBoundedlyCompleteFamily`, needed because `t ↦ E[Uψ ∣ t] − α·E[U ∣ t]`
  --      is built from the UNBOUNDED `U` — is now `complete_boundary` above. Its proof is the
  --      old `boundedlyComplete_boundary` argument with the one use of `|f| ≤ Cb` replaced by
  --      `integrable_statLaw_tilt`, which TRANSPORTS the tilted integrability from the law at
  --      `(θ₀,ϑ)` instead of dominating it; `boundedlyComplete_boundary` is now the bounded
  --      corollary, so the three other optimality theorems are unaffected and still
  --      axiom-clean. `complete_boundary` deliberately asks its two hypotheses only at
  --      parameters interior to `Ω`, which is exactly where (b) can supply them: a *pure-`θ`
  --      window* `(θ₀ ± η, ϑ)` fits inside a convex `Ω` at interior points of the surface but
  --      can fail at boundary points of it (apex of a triangle whose base straddles `θ₀`).
  --      Nothing is lost by the restriction — the admissible tilt directions then form an
  --      *open* set, which is all Laplace uniqueness needs.
  --
  -- REMAINING DEBT, in two named pieces.
  --  (d) The conditional transfer. Apply `complete_boundary` to
  --      `f t = ∫u·ψ(u,t) dκ_t − α·∫u dκ_t` at each interior boundary parameter, whose
  --      `hfzero` is `integral_U_mul_eq_of_boundary_min` composed with the disintegration
  --      `∫ E[g ∣ T] d((P p).map T) = E[g]`. That disintegration needs `Integrable (U·ψ)` and
  --      `Integrable U` for `P (θ₀,ϑ)` at FULL-measure level — the twin of the conditional
  --      `exists_boundary_ae_integrable_id`. That is `integrable_U_of_twoSided` above, PROVED
  --      (this session) exactly that way: `g z := e^{±δ z₁}` in `integrable_comp_UT_iff` turns
  --      `e^{±δ z₁}·e^{canExp (θ₀,ϑ)}` into `e^{canExp (θ₀±δ,ϑ)}`, `ν`-integrable by
  --      `integrable_canExp`, so `e^{±δU}` and hence `|U|` are `P (θ₀,ϑ)`-integrable; and
  --      `|U·ψ| ≤ |U|` gives the `ψ`-version. So (d) is now pure disintegration bookkeeping.
  --  (e) The outer UMPU assembly, which mirrors `isUMPU_conditional_outside` above line for
  --      line — the alternative `θ ≠ θ₀` is two-sided, and `exists_sep_line` already covers
  --      both signs of `c = θ − θ₀` because it is proved from convexity of `exp`, not from a
  --      sign condition.
  -- Sanctioned lifted sorry: no false statement (the two repairs are already applied), and the

/-- **Existence of measurable conditional constants (one-sided case).**

There is a measurable choice of critical value `C₀(t)` and randomization probability `γ₀(t)`
achieving conditional size `α` on the surface `T = t`, for almost every `t`.

Construction: with `F_t(u) = P_{θ₀}{U ≤ u ∣ t}` the conditional distribution function (the
`cdf` of the Markov kernel `condDistrib U T (P p₀)` evaluated at `t`), the size equation
reads `[1 − F_t(C)] + γ·[F_t(C) − F_t(C−)] = α`, solved by the conditional quantile
`C₀(t) = inf {u | F_t(u) ≥ 1 − α}` (`critC`) together with the matching interpolation weight
`γ₀(t) = (α − P_t(C₀(t), ∞)) / P_t{C₀(t)}` (`critGamma`; the junk value `x / 0 = 0` is the
correct one, since with no atom the tail already has mass exactly `α`).

The two measurability steps are, in this proof, both cheap, and *no* joint measurability of
`(u, t) ↦ F_t(u)` is needed:

* `C₀` is measurable because its sublevel sets are superlevel sets of a fixed-argument CDF:
  `C₀(t) ≤ x ↔ 1 − α ≤ F_t(x)` (the Galois property `quantile_le_iff`, here `critC_le_iff`),
  and `t ↦ F_t(x) = (κ t (Iic x)).toReal` is measurable for each fixed `x` because `κ` is a
  kernel;
* the tail and the atom at the *varying* threshold `C₀(t)` are measurable because
  `{(t,u) | C₀(t) < u}` and `{(t,u) | u = C₀(t)}` are measurable subsets of the product and
  a kernel evaluated on the sections of a measurable set is measurable
  (`Kernel.measurable_kernel_prodMk_left`).

The conclusion is in fact obtained for *every* `t`, not just almost every `t`: the
conditional laws are probability measures for every `t` since `condDistrib` is a Markov
kernel. Neither the exponential-family form `hUT` nor the measurability of `U` and `T` is
used; they are kept in the signature as stated. -/

`θ* = a₀θ + ⟪a, ϑ⟫` (`a₀ ≠ 0`), with statistic `U* = U/a₀`, `T* = T − (U/a₀)·a` and base
measure the image of `ν` under the same transformation. Consequently the four optimality
theorems above apply verbatim to hypotheses about `θ*`.

The proof is the change of variables `map_withDensity_comp` along `S = statTransformUT a₀ a`
— whose defining property is exactly `inner_exponent_reparam`, i.e. the reparametrized
density pulled back along `S` is the original density — together with `map_map` to move `S`
past the statistic. The measurability of `(U, T)` is *not* a hypothesis, and is not needed:
if it fails, the left-hand side is the zero measure by `Measure.map_of_not_aemeasurable`, and
so is the right-hand side, because `S` has a measurable left inverse `(v,s) ↦ (a₀v, s + v·a)`
(so `S ∘ (U,T)` is no more measurable than `(U,T)`) and the change of variables identifies
the right-hand side with the `S`-image of `(P p).map (U,T) = 0`.

**FLAGGED SIGNATURE AMENDMENT.** The instances `[BorelSpace Ξ]` and
`[SecondCountableTopology Ξ]` were *added*. They are what makes the shear
`S : (u,t) ↦ (u/a₀, t − (u/a₀)·a)` — a continuous map `ℝ × Ξ → ℝ × Ξ` — measurable: the
frozen `[MeasurableSpace Ξ]` is unrelated to the topology of `Ξ`, and even with
`[BorelSpace Ξ]` alone the product σ-algebra of `ℝ × Ξ` need not contain the Borel sets of
the product topology, which is what second countability supplies (`Prod.borelSpace`). Both
hold for every intended instantiation `Ξ = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)`. Nothing else in the
statement changes. -/
