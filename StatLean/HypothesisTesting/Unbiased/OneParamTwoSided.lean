# UMP unbiased two-sided tests in a one-parameter exponential family

Let `P_θ` be a one-parameter exponential family with natural statistic `T`, i.e.
`dP_θ = C(θ) e^{θ T(x)} dν(x)`, and let `θ` range over a parameter set `Ξ` inside the
interior of the natural parameter set. For the two problems

* `H : θ₁ ≤ θ ≤ θ₂` against `K : θ < θ₁ or θ > θ₂`,
* `H : θ = θ₀` against `K : θ ≠ θ₀`,

no UMP test exists, but a UMP **unbiased** test does, and in both cases it rejects outside
an interval in `T`:
$$ \varphi(x) \;=\;
   \begin{cases} 1, & T(x) < C_1 \text{ or } T(x) > C_2,\\
                 \gamma_i, & T(x) = C_i,\ i = 1,2,\\
                 0, & C_1 < T(x) < C_2. \end{cases} $$
What differs is the pair of side conditions pinning `C₁, C₂, γ₁, γ₂`:

* interval null: **two size equations** `E_{θ₁}φ = E_{θ₂}φ = α`;
* point null: the **size equation** `E_{θ₀}φ = α` *together with the derivative condition*
  `E_{θ₀}[T φ] = α·E_{θ₀}[T]`.

The derivative condition is not decoration: unbiasedness forces the power function to have a
minimum at `θ₀`, and differentiating the power of an exponential family under the integral
sign turns `β'(θ₀) = 0` into exactly `E_{θ₀}[T φ] − E_{θ₀}[T]·E_{θ₀}[φ] = 0`, which combines
with the size equation to give the displayed form. Both equations are transcribed literally
below; neither may be dropped.

Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2022 (ISBN 978-3-030-70577-0), Chapter 4 (Unbiasedness: Theory
and First Applications), §4.2 (One-Parameter Exponential Families), the UMP unbiased two-sided
tests of a one-parameter exponential family. (`TSH4 §4.2`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* *Dependency.* The critical function above is the complement `1 − φ` of the
  reject-inside-an-interval test used for the UMP problem `H : θ ≤ θ₁ or θ ≥ θ₂`, whose
  concrete definition `twoSidedTest` is drafted in
  `StatLean/HypothesisTesting/MLR/TwoSided.lean` (generalized Neyman–Pearson assembly).
  To avoid duplicating that definition here — and to keep this file independent of the
  exact shape of its arguments while both are in draft — the test enters as an abstract
  critical function `φ` constrained by four pointwise shape equations. When the assembly
  lands, these theorems should be instantiated at `1 − twoSidedTest …` (the `1 − φ`
  device by which the source derives the constants).
* The model enters as an arbitrary family `P` together with the identification
  `P θ = E.P θ` on `Ξ` (a `IsCanonicalRepr`-style hypothesis restricted to the parameter
  set actually used), so callers may keep their own parametrization; only members with
  `θ ∈ Ξ` are ever evaluated by the conclusion.
* `Ξ ⊆ interior E.natSet` is what makes the power functions continuous and differentiable
  (`continuous_power_expFamily`), which is what licenses the boundary device of
  `isUMPU_of_isUMP_on_boundary`; it also makes `T` integrable under every `P θ`, `θ ∈ Ξ`,
  so no separate integrability hypothesis is imposed on the two displayed equations.
* `C₁ ≤ C₂` is the degenerate-tolerant form of the source's `C₁ < C₂`; if `C₁ = C₂` the two
  boundary equations are compatible only when `γ₁ = γ₂`, which is the caller's obligation.

**⚠ BOTH THEOREMS BELOW WERE FALSE AS TRANSCRIBED — a missing hypothesis on `Ξ`; both are
now REPAIRED and CLOSED.** Nothing constrained `Ξ` beyond `Ξ ⊆ interior E.natSet`, so `Ξ`
could be *sparse*: the null value(s) need not be limit points of the alternative set `Θ₁`.
When they are not, unbiasedness imposes **no** equality constraint at the boundary, the
optimality problem degenerates to an ordinary one-sided Neyman–Pearson problem, and the
two-sided test loses to the one-sided one. Explicit counterexamples are recorded at each
theorem; both use the Gaussian location family `E.base = N(0,1)`, `E.stat = id`,
`E.P θ = N(θ,1)`, `natSet = ℝ`, `P θ = E.P θ` everywhere, `α = 0.05`.

**The applied amendment is `(hΞopen : IsOpen Ξ)`** in each of the two theorems, and nothing
else. It is the minimal hypothesis excluding the counterexamples, it is what the classical
statement means by "`θ` ranges over an interval interior to the natural parameter set", and
it is exactly what the proofs consume: with `Ξ` open, `θ₀ ∈ closure (Ξ \ {θ₀})` and
`θ₁, θ₂ ∈ closure {θ ∈ Ξ | θ < θ₁ ∨ θ₂ < θ}` (so the level inequality at a null value
upgrades to similarity, by continuity of the power function), and `θ₀` is an *interior*
minimum of the power function of any unbiased test (so its derivative vanishes there).

Both proofs run through the two-constraint Neyman–Pearson lemma
`isMax_of_multiplier_form` (`m = 2`, already proved), whose multiplier shape is certified by
a *separating line*: for the point null, the secant/tangent of the strictly convex
`t ↦ e^{(θ' − θ₀)t}` (`exists_sep_line`); for the interval null, the three-exponential
separation `a e^{θ₁t} + b e^{θ₂t}` versus `e^{ϑt}`, which after the substitution
`w = e^{(θ₂−θ₁)t}` is the secant of `w ↦ w^λ` with `λ = (ϑ−θ₁)/(θ₂−θ₁)`
(`exists_sep_exp3_out` for `ϑ ∉ [θ₁,θ₂]`, `exists_sep_exp3_mid` for `ϑ ∈ (θ₁,θ₂)`). The same
three-exponential separation, with the middle exponent, is what gives the level of the
reject-outside test on the *interior* of the interval null (`expFamily_level_interval`):
`(φ − α)` and the combination change sign at exactly the same two points, so their product is
pointwise nonnegative and the two size equations kill both boundary terms.

**Bibliographic comments.** UMP unbiased two-sided tests for exponential families are due to
J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson ("Contributions to the theory of testing statistical
hypotheses," *Statistical Research Memoirs* **1** (1936), 1–37), whose earlier fundamental
lemma ("On the problem of the most efficient tests of statistical hypotheses," *Phil. Trans.
R. Soc. A* **231** (1933), 289–337) supplies, in its multi-constraint form, the optimality
of tests subject to the two displayed side conditions.

/-- **The two-multiplier comparison for the point-null problem.**

Against the reference measure `ν` the three Neyman–Pearson data are the `θ₀`-density, the
`θ₀`-density weighted by `T`, and the `θ'`-density. The separating line of `exists_sep_line`
for `c = θ' − θ₀` supplies the multipliers: the rejection region `{T < C₁} ∪ {T > C₂}` is
exactly where the `θ'`-density exceeds the affine combination. -/

/-- **UMP unbiased test of a point null in a one-parameter exponential family.**

For `H : θ = θ₀` against `K : θ ≠ θ₀`, the test rejecting outside `[C₁, C₂]` on the natural
statistic scale is UMP unbiased at level `α`, provided the constants satisfy **both**

* the size condition `E_{θ₀}[φ] = α`, and
* the derivative condition `E_{θ₀}[T·φ] = α·E_{θ₀}[T]`

(the latter being the analytic form of "the power function has a minimum at `θ₀`").

**FLAGGED SIGNATURE AMENDMENT — `(hΞopen : IsOpen Ξ)` was added.** Without it the statement
is FALSE, by the following verified counterexample. Gaussian location family
`E.base = N(0,1)`, `E.stat = id`, so `E.P θ = N(θ,1)` and `E.natSet = interior E.natSet = ℝ`;
put `P θ = E.P θ`, `α = 0.05`. Take the SPARSE parameter set `Ξ = {0, 2}` and `θ₀ = 0`, so
`Θ₁ = {2}`. Take `C₁ = -1.959964`, `C₂ = 1.959964`, `γ₁ = γ₂ = 0`,
`φ = 1{|x| > 1.959964}`. Then `hφ_one/hφ_zero/hφ_γ₁/hφ_γ₂` hold, `hsize` holds
(`P₀(|X| > 1.959964) = 0.05 = α`) and `hderiv` holds (`∫ x·φ dP₀ = 0` by symmetry, while
`α·∫ x dP₀ = 0.05·0 = 0`). Yet the one-sided competitor `ψ = 1{x > 1.644854}` is a critical
function which is *unbiased* at level `α` for `Θ₀ = {0}`, `Θ₁ = {2}` (`power ψ 0 = 0.05 ≤ α`
and `power ψ 2 = 0.638760 ≥ α`), while `power φ 2 = 0.516005 < 0.638760 = power ψ 2`,
contradicting the optimality clause of `IsUMPU`. The defect is sparseness of `Ξ`: the null
value need not be a limit point of the alternative set, so unbiasedness imposes no equality
constraint at `θ₀` and the two-sided problem degenerates to a one-sided one. Openness of `Ξ`
is the minimal repair; it is what the classical statement means by "`θ` ranges over an
interval interior to the natural parameter set", and it is exactly what the proof consumes,
in two places: `θ₀` is not isolated in `Ξ` (so continuity of the power function upgrades
`power ψ θ₀ ≤ α` to `= α`) and `θ₀` is an *interior* minimum of the power function of any
unbiased test (so its derivative vanishes there).

**Proof.** Both side conditions are, for any unbiased competitor, forced
(`unbiased_side_conditions`); the displayed pair is then exactly the constraint set of the
two-constraint Neyman–Pearson lemma `isMax_of_multiplier_form`, whose multiplier shape is
supplied by the secant/tangent line of `exists_sep_line` for the strictly convex function
`t ↦ e^{(θ' − θ₀)t}` (`expFamily_np_compare`). Unbiasedness of `φ` itself is the comparison
with the constant test `α`, which satisfies both side conditions. -/

/-- **UMP unbiased test of an interval null in a one-parameter exponential family.**

For `H : θ₁ ≤ θ ≤ θ₂` against `K : θ < θ₁ or θ > θ₂`, the same reject-outside-an-interval
test is UMP unbiased at level `α`, now with the constants pinned by the **two size
equations** `E_{θ₁}[φ] = E_{θ₂}[φ] = α` (the boundary of the testing problem consists of the
two points `θ₁, θ₂`, and unbiasedness with a continuous power function forces similarity
there).

**FLAGGED SIGNATURE AMENDMENT — `(hΞopen : IsOpen Ξ)` was added.** Without it the statement
is FALSE, by the following verified counterexample. Gaussian location family
`E.P θ = N(θ,1)`, `P θ = E.P θ`, `α = 0.05`. Take the SPARSE parameter set
`Ξ = [0,1] ∪ {2}`, `θ₁ = 0`, `θ₂ = 1`, so `Θ₀ = [0,1]` and `Θ₁ = {2}` (note
`θ₁, θ₂ ∉ closure Θ₁ = {2}`). Take `C₁ = -1.681477`, `C₂ = 2.681477`, `γ₁ = γ₂ = 0`,
`φ = 1{x < C₁ ∨ x > C₂}`; by the reflection `x ↦ 1 − x` the interval is symmetric about
`1/2`, so `hsize₁ : power φ 0 = 0.05 = α` and `hsize₂ : power φ 1 = 0.05 = α`, and all the
other hypotheses hold. Yet `ψ = 1{x > 2.644854}` is a critical function, *unbiased* at level
`α` — `power ψ θ ≤ power ψ 1 = 0.05 ≤ α` for every `θ ∈ Θ₀ = [0,1]` (monotone in `θ`; e.g.
`0.004086` at `0`, `0.015982` at `1/2`) and `power ψ 2 = 0.259511 ≥ α` — while
`power φ 2 = 0.247901 < 0.259511 = power ψ 2`, contradicting the optimality clause of
`IsUMPU`. (`power φ (1/2) = 0.029148 ≤ α`, so `φ`'s own level on `Θ₀` is not the issue.) As
in `isUMPU_twoSided_expFamily`, the defect is sparseness of `Ξ`: the null endpoints need not
be limit points of the alternative set, so unbiasedness imposes no similarity constraint
there. Openness of `Ξ` is the minimal repair, and is exactly what the classical statement
means by "`θ` ranges over an interval interior to the natural parameter set". -/
