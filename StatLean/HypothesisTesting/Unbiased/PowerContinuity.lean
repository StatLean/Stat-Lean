# Continuous power functions: boundary optimality ⇒ unbiased optimality

When every test has a **continuous** power function, unbiasedness of a test forces its power
to equal `α` on the *common boundary*
$$ \omega_B \;=\; \overline{\Theta_0} \cap \overline{\Theta_1} $$
of the null set `Θ₀` and the alternative set `Θ₁` (the set of points that are points or
limit points of both). Consequently the class of tests that are **similar on `ω_B`** contains
the class of unbiased level-`α` tests, and a test that is optimal in the larger (similar)
class and has level `α` is automatically UMP unbiased. This is the standard device that
converts the two-sided optimality problems into constrained Neyman–Pearson problems.

Main results:

* `isSimilar_boundary_of_isUnbiasedTest` — unbiased + continuous power ⇒ similar on `ω_B`;
* `isUMPU_of_isUMP_on_boundary` — optimal among boundary-similar tests + level `α` ⇒ UMPU;
* `continuous_power_expFamily` — power functions of exponential families are continuous on
  the interior of the natural parameter set (statement only here);
* `continuous_power_of_isCanonicalRepr` — the same for any continuous reparametrization.

and First Applications), §4.1 (Unbiasedness for Hypothesis Testing), Lemma 4.1.1 (a test with
continuous power that is UMP on the boundary is UMP unbiased). (`TSH4 §4.1 Lem 4.1.1`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The boundary set is supplied as data together with the defining equation
  `ωB = closure Θ₀ ∩ closure Θ₁`, rather than as a definition, so that callers may
  instantiate it with the concrete finite boundary sets (`{θ₀}`, `{θ₁, θ₂}`) that the
  one-parameter applications use, discharging the equation once.
* Continuity of the power function is quantified over *all* critical functions: this is what
  the source development assumes, and it is exactly what the exponential-family smoothness
  theorem delivers.
* The constant test `φ ≡ α` is the comparison test used to derive unbiasedness of the
  optimal test; it is a critical function precisely when `0 ≤ α ≤ 1`, whence the two
  side conditions on `α`.
* `continuous_power_expFamily` is stated as `ContinuousOn` over `interior E.natSet`: at
  boundary points of the natural parameter set the interchange of limit and integral can
  fail, and the source theorem is likewise restricted to the interior.

**Bibliographic comments.** Unbiasedness for testing problems, and the boundary-similarity
device recorded here, are due to J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson ("Contributions to the theory
of testing statistical hypotheses," *Statistical Research Memoirs* **1** (1936), 1–37),
building on their earlier optimality theory ("On the problem of the most efficient tests of
statistical hypotheses," *Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A* **231** (1933), 289–337). The analyticity
of integrals against exponential-family densities, which supplies the continuity hypothesis,
goes back to the work systematized in O. Barndorff-Nielsen (*Information and Exponential
Families in Statistical Theory*, Wiley, 1978) and L. D. Brown (*Fundamentals of Statistical
Exponential Families*, IMS Lecture Notes 9, 1986).

/-- **Unbiased ⇒ similar on the boundary.**

If every power function is continuous, then a test that is unbiased at level `α` for
`Θ₀` against `Θ₁` has power exactly `α` on the common boundary
`ωB = closure Θ₀ ∩ closure Θ₁`: on `closure Θ₀` continuity propagates `power ≤ α`, on
`closure Θ₁` it propagates `α ≤ power`. -/

/-- **Boundary optimality ⇒ UMP unbiasedness.**

Assume every power function is continuous, and let `φ₀` be a level-`α` test that is similar
on the common boundary `ωB` and uniformly at least as powerful, on `Θ₁`, as every test that
is similar on `ωB`. Then `φ₀` is UMP unbiased at level `α`.

Two steps: the boundary-similar class contains the unbiased class
(`isSimilar_boundary_of_isUnbiasedTest`), so `φ₀` beats every unbiased competitor; and `φ₀`
is itself unbiased because the constant test `φ ≡ α` is boundary-similar.

The hypothesis `hsim` records that `φ₀` belongs to the class it is optimal in, as the source
formulation ("uniformly most powerful *among* the tests satisfying the boundary condition")
does; it is not consumed by the argument sketched above and may be dropped if a later
refactor prefers the minimal hypothesis set. -/

/-- **Power functions of an exponential family are continuous on the interior of the natural
parameter set.**

For a bounded measurable `φ`, `η ↦ ∫ φ dP_η` is continuous on `interior E.natSet`. Writing
`P_η = ν.tilted ⟪η, T ·⟫`, the power is the ratio
`(∫ φ e^{⟪η,T⟫} dν) / (∫ e^{⟪η,T⟫} dν)`; both integrals are differentiable — hence continuous
— on the interior of the corresponding weighted natural parameter sets by
`ExpFamily.continuousOn_integral_exp_inner`, and `|φ| ≤ 1` places `E.natSet` inside the
`φ`-weighted natural set, so both are continuous on `interior E.natSet`. The denominator is
positive there whenever `ν ≠ 0`, and for `ν = 0` every `P_η` vanishes and the power is
constantly `0`.

**FLAGGED SIGNATURE AMENDMENT.** The two instance hypotheses `[BorelSpace V]` and
`[FiniteDimensional ℝ V]` were *added* to the frozen statement: without a finite-dimension
assumption the theorem is **false**. Counterexample. Let `V` be the incomplete inner-product
space `c₀₀ ⊆ ℓ²` of finitely supported real sequences, `𝓧 = ℕ` with the discrete σ-algebra,
`ν{0} = 1` and `ν{n} = e^{-n²}` for `n ≥ 1`, and `T 0 = 0`, `T n = n³ eₙ`. For finitely
supported `η` all but finitely many terms of `∫ e^{⟪η,T⟫} dν = 1 + ∑_{n≥1} e^{-n² + n³ηₙ}`
equal `e^{-n²}`, so `E.natSet = V` and `interior E.natSet = V ∋ 0`. Take `φ = 1_{\{0\}}`
(a critical function). The numerator `∫ φ e^{⟪η,T⟫} dν = 1` is constant, while at
`η_k = k⁻¹ e_k → 0` the denominator is `2 + S − e^{-k²}` versus `1 + S` at `η = 0`
(`S = ∑_{n≥1} e^{-n²}`), because the `n = k` term becomes `e^{-k² + k³/k} = 1`. So the power
tends to `1/(2+S) ≠ 1/(1+S)`. The failure is genuine: in infinite dimensions membership of
`η` in the *interior* of the natural parameter set does not bound `∫ e^{⟪·,T⟫} dν` on a
neighbourhood of `η`, which is exactly what the `2^{dim V}` sign-vector envelope of
`ExpFamily.integrable_abs_exp_inner_add_norm` supplies in finite dimensions. `[BorelSpace V]`
is likewise needed because the frozen signature leaves `MeasurableSpace V` unrelated to the
topology; every intended instantiation is `V = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)`, where both hold. -/
