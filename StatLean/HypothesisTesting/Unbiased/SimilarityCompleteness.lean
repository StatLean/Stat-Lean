# Similar tests have Neyman structure iff the sufficient statistic is boundedly complete

Fix a boundary family `{P_θ : θ ∈ ω}` and a statistic `T` that is sufficient for it, with
θ-free conditional (Markov) kernel `Q`. A test `φ` is **similar** on `ω` when its power is
identically `α` there, and it has **Neyman structure** when its *conditional* size given
`T = t` equals `α`. Neyman structure always implies similarity (average the conditional
size); the converse — every similar test has Neyman structure — holds exactly when the
family of laws of `T` on `ω` is **boundedly complete**:

* `hasNeymanStructure_of_boundedlyComplete` — bounded completeness ⇒ every similar test has
  Neyman structure;
* `boundedlyComplete_of_forall_similar_hasNeymanStructure` — the converse.

This is the engine that reduces optimal similar tests to a family of one-dimensional
conditional Neyman–Pearson problems, one on each surface `T = t`.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and J.P. Romano, *Testing Statistical Hypotheses*, 4th ed.,
Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2022 (ISBN 978-3-030-70577-0), Chapter 4 (Unbiasedness: Theory
and First Applications), §4.3 (Similarity and Completeness), Theorem 4.3.2 (similar tests have
Neyman structure iff the sufficient statistic is boundedly complete), together with Theorem
4.3.1 (completeness of the natural statistic of a full-rank family). (`TSH4 §4.3 Thm 4.3.2,
Thm 4.3.1`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* *The almost-everywhere carrier.* The source states both the Neyman-structure condition and
  the completeness conclusion "a.e. `𝒫^T`", meaning: outside one exceptional set that is
  null under **every** member of the family. For a *fixed* function this is literally
  equivalent to the per-parameter form `∀ θ ∈ ω, ∀ᵐ t ∂(statLaw P T θ), …` used below
  (both say that `{t | …}` has measure zero under every `statLaw P T θ`, `θ ∈ ω`), so we
  quantify over every boundary parameter rather than fixing a single dominating reference
  measure `ν`. Instantiating `HasNeymanStructure` at `ν := statLaw P T θ` for each `θ ∈ ω`
  is exactly that reading.
* Sufficiency enters in the graph (`compProd`) form: `(P θ).map (x ↦ (T x, x)) =
  statLaw P T θ ⊗ₘ Q`. Beyond disintegration this pins `Q t` to the fibre `{x | T x = t}`
  for a.e. `t`, which the converse direction needs in order to compute the conditional size
  of a test of the form `c·f(T ·) + α`.
* Sufficiency and bounded completeness are required only on the boundary family, so both
  are stated for the restriction `fun θ : ω => …`; a sufficient statistic for the whole
  model restricts to one for any subfamily, but the converse is false for completeness, and
  the boundary subfamily is the one the applications complete.
* The converse direction needs `0 < α < 1`: the perturbation `φ = c·f(T ·) + α` used to
  contradict bounded completeness is a critical function only for `c ≤ min(α, 1−α)/M`,
  which is positive precisely then.

**Bibliographic comments.** Similar regions and the notion of Neyman structure are due to
J. Neyman ("Sur la vérification des hypothèses statistiques composées," *Bull. Soc. Math.
France* **63** (1935), 246–266; "Outline of a theory of statistical estimation based on the
classical theory of probability," *Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A* **236** (1937), 333–380). The
equivalence with (bounded) completeness of the sufficient statistic, and the completeness
concept itself, are due to E. L. Lehmann and H. Scheffé ("Completeness, similar regions, and
unbiased estimation," *Sankhyā* **10** (1950), 305–340; **15** (1955), 219–236).

/-- **Bounded completeness ⇒ Neyman structure.**

If the laws of the sufficient statistic `T` over the boundary set `ω` form a boundedly
complete family, then every similar level-`α` test has Neyman structure: its conditional
size given `T = t` equals `α` for almost every `t`, under every boundary parameter.

Proof route: similarity says `∫ (φ − α) dP_θ = 0` for `θ ∈ ω`; disintegrating along `T`
turns this into `∫ ψ d(statLaw P T θ) = 0` for the bounded measurable function
`ψ t = ∫ φ dQ_t − α`; bounded completeness forces `ψ = 0` a.e. -/

/-- **Neyman structure for all similar tests ⇒ bounded completeness.**

Converse direction. Let `f` be bounded measurable with `∫ f d(statLaw) = 0` at every boundary
parameter. The perturbation `ψ = c·f(T ·) + α`, with `c = min(α, 1−α)/M` and `M` a positive
bound for `|f|`, is a critical function of power `c·∫ f d(statLaw) + α = α`, hence similar; so
`hall` gives `∀ᵐ t, ∫ ψ dQ_t = α`, i.e. `h t := ∫ f(T x) dQ_t = 0` for a.e. `t`.

It remains to identify `h` with `f`. Rather than exhibiting the fibre support of `Q` — which
would need the diagonal `{(t,x) | T x = t}` to be measurable, hence a standard-Borel structure
on `𝓣` absent from the signature — we test the graph identity `hsuff` against the *bounded
measurable weight* `g = h − f`: integrating `(t,x) ↦ g t · f (T x)` over
`(P θ).map (x ↦ (T x, x)) = statLaw ⊗ₘ Q` two ways gives `∫ g·f = ∫ g·h` over `statLaw`,
i.e. `∫ (h − f)² d(statLaw) = 0`, whence `h = f` a.e. Combining with `h = 0` a.e. yields
`f = 0` a.e. This route needs no hypothesis beyond the frozen signature. -/
