# Split-conformal prediction coverage guarantee

**Split-conformal prediction.** Consider $n+1$ nonconformity scores $S_0, \dots, S_{n-1}$
(from the calibration sample) together with a test score $S_n$, for a total of $m = n+1$ scores
that are **exchangeable** and almost surely pairwise distinct. The split-conformal prediction set
$\hat C$ is formed from the $k$-th smallest calibration score, where $k = \lceil (n+1)(1-\alpha)\rceil$.
Then the prediction set covers the test point with probability at least $1 - \alpha$:
$$
\mathbb{P}\bigl(Y_{n+1} \in \hat C\bigr) \;\ge\; 1 - \alpha .
$$
The covering event $\{Y_{n+1} \in \hat C\}$ is exactly the event that the test score is among the
$k$ smallest of the $m = n+1$ scores, i.e. $\{S_n \le S_{(k)}\}$, which equals
$\{\operatorname{rank}(S_n) \le k\}$.

**Main result** (`conformal_coverage`): with $k = \lceil (n+1)(1-\alpha)\rceil$,
$$
1 - \alpha \;\le\; \mathbb{P}\bigl(\operatorname{rank}(S_n) \le k\bigr).
$$

**Proof formalization notes.** By rank uniformity (`measure_rankOf_le`), the rank of the test score
is uniform on $\{1, \dots, n+1\}$, so $\mathbb{P}(\operatorname{rank}(S_n) \le k) = k/(n+1)$; and
$k = \lceil (n+1)(1-\alpha)\rceil \ge (n+1)(1-\alpha)$ gives $k/(n+1) \ge 1 - \alpha$. The Lean
proof proceeds in three steps: (1) $k \le n+1$, since $(n+1)(1-\alpha) \le n+1$ as $1 - \alpha \le 1$;
(2) apply `measure_rankOf_le` to rewrite the probability as $k/(n+1)$; (3) bridge through
`ENNReal.ofReal` and discharge $k/(n+1) \ge 1 - \alpha$ via the ceiling lower bound `Nat.le_ceil`.
The exchangeability, measurability, and a.s.-distinctness hypotheses are genuine external inputs
on the score family (Candès L9 §9.6).

**Bibliographic comments.** Split (a.k.a. inductive) conformal prediction originates with
H. Papadopoulos, K. Proedrou, V. Vovk & A. Gammerman, "Inductive Confidence Machines for
Regression", *ECML 2002*, LNCS 2430, pp. 345–356, and is developed systematically in V. Vovk,
A. Gammerman & G. Shafer, *Algorithmic Learning in a Random World*, Springer, 2005. The finite-sample
marginal coverage guarantee for split conformal in the regression setting, in the form proved here,
is Theorem 2.2 (with the companion full-conformal statement Theorem 2.1) of J. Lei, M. G'Sell,
A. Rinaldo, R. J. Tibshirani & L. Wasserman, "Distribution-Free Predictive Inference for Regression",
*Journal of the American Statistical Association* 113(523):1094–1111, 2018. The mechanism is the
exchangeability of the augmented score sample, which makes the rank of the test score uniform; the
$1-\alpha$ guarantee then follows from the ceiling choice of order statistic.

/-- **Conformal coverage** (Lu-BDA Ch 19, §19.1 Conformal Inference; also Candès, Lecture 9, §9.6,
Theorem 2, STAT 300C). For `n+1` exchangeable,
a.s. distinct scores, the split-conformal prediction set built from the `⌈(n+1)(1−α)⌉`-th smallest
score covers the test point (the `rankOf S (last) ≤ k` event) with probability at least `1 − α`. -/
