# E-to-p conversion: the reciprocal of an e-value is a conservative p-value

Let $E$ be an *e-variable* for a simple null hypothesis with law $\mu$ — a nonnegative random
variable with $\mathbb{E}_\mu[E] \le 1$. Then its reciprocal $1/E$ is a (conservative) *p-variable*:
for every level $\alpha \in (0,1)$,
$$ \mu\{\,1/E \le \alpha\,\} \le \alpha. $$
This is the simplest *calibrator* turning evidence measured on the e-value scale into a valid
p-value, so e-values plug directly into p-value-based multiple-testing procedures.

The main result (`isPVariable_inv_of_isEVariable`) states exactly this. We also record the
companion `superUniform_inv_of_isEVariable`, which says $1/E$ is *super-uniform*
($\mu\{1/E \le t\} \le t$ for all $t \ge 0$, not only $t \in (0,1)$) — the form consumed by the
Benjamini–Hochberg / Holm assembly files, so e-values feed directly into FDR control.

**Added hypothesis (Lean-only).** Beyond the e-variable assumption, the formalization requires $E$
to be strictly positive pointwise, $E(\omega) > 0$. This rules out Lean's `1/0 = 0` convention,
which would otherwise map the no-evidence event $E = 0$ (intuitively p-value $1$) to $1/E = 0$ and
spuriously inflate $\mu\{1/E \le \alpha\}$. E-variables arising as likelihood ratios are positive,
so this is no loss of generality.

**Reference.** E. J. Candès, *STAT 300C: Theory of Statistics*, Lecture Notes, Stanford University,
2023, Lecture 15, Proposition 3 (e-to-p calibration).

**Proof formalization notes.** Fix $\alpha \in (0,1)$. With $E > 0$ we have the equivalence
$1/E \le \alpha \iff E \ge 1/\alpha$, so Markov's inequality gives
$\mu\{E \ge 1/\alpha\} \le \alpha \cdot \mathbb{E}_\mu[E] \le \alpha$, using $\mathbb{E}_\mu[E] \le 1$.
In Lean the event is rewritten in `ENNReal.ofReal` form and closed by the extended-nonnegative
Markov bound `meas_ge_le_lintegral_div`, after which `ENNReal.div_le_div_right` together with the
e-variable bound `hE.expectation_le_one` and `ENNReal.ofReal_inv_of_pos` finishes the calc. The
super-uniform version extends the bound from $(0,1)$ to all $t \ge 0$ by separately handling $t = 0$
(where $E > 0$ makes the event $\{1/E \le 0\}$ empty).

**Bibliographic comments.** The reciprocal calibrator is due to Vladimir Vovk and Ruodu Wang,
"E-values: Calibration, combination and applications", *The Annals of Statistics* **49**(3):
1736–1754, 2021 (DOI 10.1214/20-AOS2020). There, calibrators from e-values to p-values are studied
systematically (their §2); the map $e \mapsto \min(1, 1/e)$ — equivalently the bound used here,
$\mu\{1/E \le \alpha\} \le \alpha$ — is the canonical such calibrator and follows from Markov's
inequality. The Candès lecture notes present this as the standard e-to-p conversion.
