# Kolmogorov–Smirnov test — level guarantee

The one-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test of the global null hypothesis rejects when the one-sided KS
statistic
$$ \mathrm{KS}^{+} \;=\; \sup_{t} \bigl(F_n(t) - t\bigr) $$
exceeds the threshold $u_\alpha = \sqrt{\log(n/\alpha) / (2n)}$, where $F_n$ is the empirical CDF of
$n$ p-values. Under the global null — that the $n$ p-values are jointly independent and each is
super-uniform (its CDF lies below the uniform CDF) — the test has **level** $\alpha$, i.e. its
type-I error is controlled:
$$ \mu\bigl\{\, \mathrm{KS}^{+} \ge u_\alpha \,\bigr\} \;\le\; \alpha . $$
This follows immediately from the one-sided KS union-bound tail inequality (formalized in
`ForMathlib/EmpiricalProcessSup.ksPlus_tail_union`): substituting the threshold $u_\alpha$ makes the
union tail equal to $n\,e^{-2n\,u_\alpha^{2}} = n\cdot(\alpha/n) = \alpha$.

The sharp Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz–Massart constant would let the threshold improve to
$\sqrt{\log(2/\alpha)/(2n)}$; the version proved here uses the (weaker) union-bound tail, which is the
inequality actually available in the library.

**Proof formalization notes.** The main result (`ks_test_level`): under the global null (jointly
independent, super-uniform p-values), $\mu\{\mathrm{KS}^{+} \ge u_\alpha\} \le \alpha$. The proof
plugs the threshold $u = u_\alpha$ (which is $\ge 0$) into the one-sided union-bound KS tail
`ksPlus_tail_union`, then simplifies the resulting bound $n\,e^{-2n u_\alpha^{2}} = \alpha$ using
$u_\alpha^{2} = \log(n/\alpha)/(2n)$ and $e^{-\log(n/\alpha)} = \alpha/n$. The library uses the
union-bound tail rather than the sharp Massart constant, hence the threshold $\sqrt{\log(n/\alpha)/(2n)}$
in place of the sharper $\sqrt{\log(2/\alpha)/(2n)}$.

**Bibliographic comments.** The two-sided KS statistic and its limiting distribution originate with
A. N. Kolmogorov, "Sulla determinazione empirica di una legge di distribuzione," *Giornale
dell'Istituto Italiano degli Attuari* **4** (1933), 83–91, who derived the asymptotic distribution of
$\sqrt{n}\,\sup_t |F_n(t) - F(t)|$ for continuous $F$. N. V. Smirnov, "Table for estimating the
goodness of fit of empirical distributions," *Annals of Mathematical Statistics* **19** (1948),
279–281, tabulated the limiting distribution and studied the two-sample form. The *non-asymptotic*
exponential tail bound used here (and the underlying finite-$n$ control of the empirical process
supremum) is the Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz inequality — A. Dvoretzky, J. Kiefer, and J. Wolfowitz,
"Asymptotic minimax character of the sample distribution function and of the classical multinomial
estimator," *Annals of Mathematical Statistics* **27** (1956), 642–669 — with the sharp leading
constant established by P. Massart, "The tight constant in the Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz
inequality," *Annals of Probability* **18** (1990), 1269–1283. The specific level-$\alpha$ KS test
calibration formalized here is the textbook synthesis presented in Candès's STAT 300C notes; the
union-bound threshold $\sqrt{\log(n/\alpha)/(2n)}$ is a standard pedagogical simplification rather
than a separately seminal result.
