# Knock-off score — definition

Concept-layer data model for the knock-off filter.

A **knock-off score** is a vector of feature statistics $W = (W_1, \dots, W_d)$, $W_j : \Omega \to
\mathbb{R}$, for which large positive values flag relevant features. Its defining distributional
property is the *coin-flip property* for null features: conditional on the magnitudes
$\lvert W_1\rvert, \dots, \lvert W_d\rvert$, the signs of the null coordinates
$\{\operatorname{sign} W_j : j \in H_0\}$ are independent and identically distributed fair coins,
each $\pm 1$ with probability $\tfrac12$, and independent of all observed data. We formalize exactly
that property — the only thing the FDR-control proof consumes — as three fields on `KnockoffScore`:

* `signs_iIndep`     — the null signs $\{\operatorname{sign} W_j : j \in H_0\}$ are jointly
  independent;
* `signs_fair`       — each null sign is fair, $\Pr(W_j \ge 0) = \tfrac12$;
* `signs_indep_outer` — the null sign vector is independent of the *outer data* (the magnitudes
  $\lvert W_1\rvert, \dots, \lvert W_d\rvert$ together with the non-null signs), the data the count
  filtration conditions on.

Together these say: *conditional on the magnitudes and the non-null signs, the null signs are i.i.d.
$\mathrm{Ber}(\tfrac12)$* (the textbook's `kos` condition 3). The book's antisymmetry (condition 1)
is an upstream property of the *construction* of $W$ that guarantees this coin-flip property;
condition 2 ($W_j \stackrel{d}{=} -W_j$ for nulls) is a consequence of the three fields. The
procedure ($S_\pm$, $\widehat{\mathrm{FDP}}$, the data-dependent threshold $t^*$, the rejection set)
lives in the assembly file `Knockoff.lean`.

**Proof formalization notes.** We keep only the distributional consequence the supermartingale
argument actually uses, rather than the antisymmetric *construction* of $W$. The third field
`signs_indep_outer` strengthens an earlier `signs_indep_mag` (which asserted independence from the
magnitudes only): the null sign vector is required independent of the magnitudes **together with**
the non-null signs, encoded — as in `cproc` — by the padded vector
`fun j => if j ∈ H₀ then 0 else sgn Wⱼ`. This is the genuine model-X knock-off property (null signs
are fresh fair coins independent of all observed data) and is exactly what the exchangeable
supermartingale step (`count_condExp`) consumes; conditioning only on the magnitudes is too weak.
`sgnReal` uses the convention $\operatorname{sign}(W_j) = +1$ when $W_j \ge 0$ and $-1$ otherwise;
under the no-ties assumption $W_j \ne 0$ a.s. (supplied as a theorem hypothesis downstream) this
agrees with the genuine sign. The `meas` field records that each $W_j$ is measurable, needed for the
natural filtration / adaptedness / integrability machinery in `Knockoff/Supermartingale.lean`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The fixed-design knock-off filter and its key distributional engine — for
null features, the contrast statistics $W_j$ are symmetric about zero with signs that are i.i.d.
fair coin flips, independent of the magnitudes — originate with R. F. Barber and E. J. Candès,
"Controlling the false discovery rate via knockoffs," *Annals of Statistics* **43**(5) (2015),
2055–2085 (the i.i.d.-sign property is their Lemma 1). The model-X generalization formalized here,
in which the null signs are independent of all observed data rather than of a single sufficient
statistic, is due to E. Candès, Y. Fan, L. Janson and J. Lv, "Panning for gold: 'model-X' knockoffs
for high-dimensional controlled variable selection," *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society:
Series B* **80**(3) (2018), 551–577.
