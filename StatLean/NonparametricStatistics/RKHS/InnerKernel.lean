# The RKHS induced by the inner product of a Hilbert space

For a Hilbert space `L`, the inner product `K(x, y) = ⟪x, y⟫` is a kernel function on the
set `L`, and the corresponding RKHS is the space of bounded linear functionals of the
form `v ↦ ⟪v, w⟫` — i.e. `L` itself, acting on `L` through the (anti-)duality.  We
realize this concretely: `L` carries an RKHS structure over the set `X = L` with
`coeCLM w = fun v => ⟪v, w⟫_𝕜`, under which the kernel function of the point `x` is `x`
itself and the reproducing kernel is the inner product.

The structure is provided as a `def` (`dualRKHS`), not a global instance: making every
Hilbert space coerce to functions on itself would pollute downstream elaboration.

**Reference.** V. I. Paulsen and M. Raghupathi, *An Introduction to the Theory of Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Spaces*, Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics 152, Cambridge University Press,
2016. Chapter 2, §2.3.4, Proposition 2.24 (the RKHS induced by the inner product) and Exercise
2.10.

**Proof formalization notes.** With Mathlib's convention (inner conjugate-linear in the first
slot), `coeCLM` must put the representing element in the *second* slot, so the members of the dual
RKHS are the functions $v \mapsto \langle v, w\rangle$ — continuous *conjugate-linear*
functionals. The book's Proposition 2.24 (linear functionals) and Exercise 2.10 (conjugate-linear
functionals) therefore swap roles: the ℂ-linear range statement is FALSE here (machine-checked
witness `dualRKHS_range_coe_false`, kept in-file: on `L = ℂ` the element `1` acts as `conj`), and
the correct statement — proved — is Riesz–Fréchet for conjugate-linear functionals, `range = {⇑T :
T ∈ L →L⋆[𝕜] 𝕜}`.

**Bibliographic comments.** This is the Riesz–Fréchet representation theorem (F. Riesz
1907, M. Fréchet 1907) read as a statement about reproducing kernels; see also
N. Aronszajn, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. **68** (1950), §I.3.

/-- Machine-checked witness that `dualRKHS_range_coe` is FALSE over `𝕜 = ℂ`.

`coeCLM` must be `𝕜`-*linear* in the RKHS element, and Mathlib's inner product is linear in
its *second* slot; hence the element `w` is forced into the second slot and the function it
represents is `v ↦ ⟪v, w⟫_𝕜`, which is *conjugate*-linear in `v`.  So the range of the
coercion is the set of continuous conjugate-linear functionals, not the linear ones.

Witness: `L = 𝕜 = ℂ`, `w = 1`, whose function is `conj`.  If `conj = ⇑T` for some
`T : ℂ →L[ℂ] ℂ` then `T 1 = 1`, so `T I = I • T 1 = I`, while `conj I = -I`. -/

/-- Under `dualRKHS`, the functions of the RKHS are exactly the bounded *conjugate-linear*

first slot), the element `w` acts as `v ↦ ⟪v, w⟫_𝕜`, which is conjugate-linear in `v`; over
`ℝ` these are just the bounded linear functionals, recovering the classical statement.
(The `𝕜`-linear version is false over `ℂ` — see `dualRKHS_range_coe_false` above; this is
the classical duality-of-conventions between the inner-product kernel and its conjugate.) -/
