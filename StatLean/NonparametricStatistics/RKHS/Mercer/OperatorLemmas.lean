# Norm-attaining vectors of positive operators are eigenvectors

Two Hilbert-space lemmas feeding the constructive proof of Mercer's theorem:

* if `‖A h‖ = ‖A‖` for a unit vector `h`, then `A` maps the orthogonal complement of `h`
  into the orthogonal complement of `A h` (a first-derivative argument on
  `t ↦ ‖A(cos t · h + sin t · k)‖²`);
* consequently, a unit vector at which a *positive* operator attains its norm is an
  eigenvector with eigenvalue `‖P‖`.

**Bibliographic comments.** Classical operator theory; see F. Riesz and B. Sz.-Nagy,
*Functional Analysis* (1955), §93 (norm-attaining vectors of symmetric operators).

/-- Auxiliary: the *real part* of `⟪A h, A k⟫` vanishes for `k ⊥ h`, obtained from the
inequality `‖A (h + s • k)‖² ≤ ‖A‖² ‖h + s • k‖²` for real `s` (the linear-in-`s` term of
a quadratic dominated by a quadratic with matching constant term must vanish). -/
