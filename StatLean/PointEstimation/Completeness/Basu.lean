# Independence of a complete sufficient statistic from an ancillary statistic

If `T` is a boundedly complete sufficient statistic for a family of probability measures and
`V` is ancillary — its law does not depend on the parameter — then `T` and `V` are
independent under every member of the family. The argument is short and is the reason
completeness is the right strengthening of sufficiency: for a measurable set `A`, the
conditional probability `η_A(t) = P(V ∈ A ∣ T = t)` is parameter-free by sufficiency, its
mean `E_θ[η_A(T)] = P_θ(V ∈ A)` is parameter-free by ancillarity, and completeness applied to
`η_A − P(V ∈ A)` — a function bounded by `1` — forces `η_A` to be constant almost everywhere.
Constancy of the conditional probability is exactly independence.

* `IsCompleteFamily.boundedlyComplete` / `completeStat_boundedlyCompleteStat` — completeness
  implies bounded completeness for families of probability measures;
* `indepFun_of_boundedlyComplete_sufficient` — the independence theorem.

**Reference.** Classical completeness and ancillarity theory; original sources in the
bibliographic comments below.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The theorem is stated with **bounded** completeness, which is all the proof consumes: the
  test function `η_A − P(V ∈ A)` is bounded by `1`. Stating it this way makes it strictly
  more applicable than the version assuming full completeness, and
  `completeStat_boundedlyCompleteStat` bridges the two whenever a caller has the stronger
  hypothesis.
* Sufficiency is taken in the kernel (graph/compProd) form. That form is what delivers the
  single θ-free determination `η_A(t) = Q t (V ⁻¹' A)` of the conditional probability
  simultaneously for all `A`, together with the fibre property that makes
  `E_θ[η_A(T)] = P_θ(V ∈ A)` a plain disintegration identity rather than an a.e. juggling
  argument.
* Both statistics are required measurable; `T` because the completeness hypothesis is about
  the family of its laws, and `V` because `Q t (V ⁻¹' A)` must be a measurable function of
  `t`. Neither codomain needs any structure beyond a measurable space, so the ancillary
  statistic is allowed to take values in a space different from the sufficient statistic's.
* `completeStat_boundedlyCompleteStat` is the specialization of `IsCompleteFamily.
  boundedlyComplete` to laws of a statistic; measurability of the statistic enters only to
  know that each pushed-forward law is again a probability measure, under which a bounded
  measurable function is automatically integrable.

**Bibliographic comments.** Completeness and its role in unbiased estimation and similar
regions are due to E. L. Lehmann and H. Scheffé ("Completeness, similar regions, and unbiased
estimation," *Sankhyā* **10** (1950), 305–340; **15** (1955), 219–236). The independence
result proved here is due to D. Basu ("On statistics independent of a complete sufficient
statistic," *Sankhyā* **15** (1955), 377–380).
