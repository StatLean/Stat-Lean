# Complete and ancillary statistics — core data model

A family of laws `Q : Θ → Measure S` is **complete** when the only (integrable, real)
functions with identically vanishing mean are a.e. zero, and **boundedly complete** when
the same holds among bounded functions. A statistic `T` is complete for a model `P` when
the family of its laws is; a statistic `V` is **ancillary** when its law does not depend
on `θ`, and **first-order ancillary** when its mean does not.

* `IsCompleteFamily Q`, `IsBoundedlyCompleteFamily Q` — family-of-laws forms;
* `IsCompleteStat P T`, `IsBoundedlyCompleteStat P T` — statistic forms (laws of `T`);
* `IsAncillary P V`, `IsFirstOrderAncillary P V`.

**Reference.** Classical completeness/ancillarity theory; original sources in the
bibliographic comments below.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* Completeness is stated family-first so that it applies uniformly to laws of
  statistics, to exponential families on their natural statistic scale, and to the
  bounded variant needed by similar-test theory.
* `IsCompleteFamily → IsBoundedlyCompleteFamily` for probability families (bounded ⇒
  integrable) is proved in `Completeness.Basic` lemmas where needed; the two predicates
  are kept independent here.
* The full (unbounded) variant quantifies over measurable, everywhere-integrable `f`;
  conclusions are `f =ᵐ[Q θ] 0` for every `θ` (the classical "a.e. 𝒫" conclusion).

**Bibliographic comments.** Completeness and its use for unbiased estimation and
similar tests are due to E. L. Lehmann and H. Scheffé ("Completeness, similar regions,
and unbiased estimation," *Sankhyā* **10** (1950), 305–340; **15** (1955), 219–236).
Ancillarity goes back to R. A. Fisher (*Statistical Methods and Scientific Inference*,
Oliver & Boyd, 1956); the independence theorem linking the two notions is due to
D. Basu ("On statistics independent of a complete sufficient statistic," *Sankhyā*
**15** (1955), 377–380).
