# The conditional-risk engine

Every minimum risk equivariant (MRE) construction in this development has the same shape.
After the equivariant class has been parametrised by a maximal invariant `Z` — the
differences for location, the coordinate ratios for scale, both for location-scale — the
competing estimators are exactly the members of a **template family** `F w x` indexed by
a real number `w` chosen as a function `w = v(Z x)` of the maximal invariant. Minimizing
the risk over the whole equivariant class then reduces to minimizing, separately inside
each fibre of `Z`, the conditional expected loss over the *constant* choices of `w`.

This file isolates that reduction once:

* `orbitCondKernel P₀ Z` — the conditional distribution of the data given the maximal
  invariant, i.e. the regular conditional probability of `X` given `Z(X)`;
* `lintegral_eq_lintegral_condDistrib` — the disintegration identity that expresses an
  integral of `g (Z x) x` as an iterated integral over the fibres;
* `lintegral_le_of_condMinimizer` — the engine proper: an almost-everywhere fibrewise
  minimizer `v*` beats every measurable competitor `v` globally.

The location instantiation uses `F w x = δ₀ x − w` (`LocationMRE`); the scale
instantiation uses `F w x = δ₀ x / w` (`ScaleMRE`).

**Proof formalization notes.**
* **Argument order.** Mathlib's `condDistrib Y X μ` is the conditional law of `Y` *given*
  `X`: the conditioned variable comes first, the conditioning variable second. The
  conditional distribution of the data given the maximal invariant is therefore
  `condDistrib id Z P₀`, a `Kernel 𝓩 𝓧`. `orbitCondKernel` pins this order once so that
  the three instantiations cannot silently transpose it.
* The disintegration rests on `ProbabilityTheory.compProd_map_condDistrib`, which gives
  `(P₀.map Z) ⊗ₘ condDistrib id Z P₀ = P₀.map (fun x => (Z x, x))`; the iterated integral
  is then `MeasureTheory.lintegral_compProd` and the left-hand side is `lintegral_map`.
* The fibrewise hypothesis quantifies over **constant** `w`, while the conclusion
  compares against a competitor `v (Z x)` that varies across fibres. This is exactly
  right: inside the fibre `{Z = z}` the competitor takes the single value `v z`, so the
  hypothesis instantiated at `w := v z` is what the fibrewise comparison needs.
* Everything is stated in `ℝ≥0∞` through `ENNReal.ofReal ∘ ρ` (junk-value discipline),
  so no integrability side conditions are needed for the *statement*; a non-integrable
  loss records `∞` and the inequality still carries content.
* `StandardBorelSpace 𝓧` and `Nonempty 𝓧` are what make `condDistrib` a genuine kernel;
  `𝓩` needs only a measurable structure, but the instantiations supply standard Borel
  spaces there too.
* Existence of a fibrewise minimizer is *not* proved here — it is a hypothesis. Where it
  has to be produced (convex non-monotone losses) the intended route is the convex
  minimizer and measurable-argmin bricks in the `ForMathlib` layer of this area; this
  file deliberately does not depend on them.

equivariant estimators is due to E. J. G. Pitman, "The estimation of the location and
scale parameters of a continuous population of any given form," *Biometrika* **30**
(1939), 391–421, and in its general group-theoretic form to G. A. Hunt and C. Stein

/-- The **conditional distribution of the data given a maximal invariant**: the regular
conditional probability of `X` given `Z(X)`, as a Markov kernel `𝓩 ⇝ 𝓧`.

This is `condDistrib id Z P₀`; note that Mathlib's `condDistrib Y X μ` conditions the
*first* argument on the second, so the identity map (the data) comes first and the
statistic `Z` second. Edge behaviour: for a `Z` that is not almost-everywhere measurable
the underlying `condDistrib` falls back to Mathlib's junk value, so all theorems below
carry a measurability hypothesis on `Z`. -/

/-- **The conditional-risk engine.** Let `F : ℝ → 𝓧 → ℝ` be a template family of
estimators indexed by a real parameter and let `ρ` be a loss. If a measurable `v*`
minimizes, for almost every value `z` of the statistic `Z` and over all *constant*
choices `w`, the conditional expected loss

`w ↦ ∫⁻ x, ENNReal.ofReal (ρ (F w x)) ∂(orbitCondKernel P₀ Z z)`,

then the estimator `x ↦ F (v* (Z x)) x` has the smallest overall expected loss among all
estimators of the form `x ↦ F (v (Z x)) x` with `v` measurable.

Instantiated at `F w x = δ₀ x − w` this is the location MRE construction, and at
`F w x = δ₀ x / w` the scale MRE construction; in both cases the class of competitors is
precisely the measurable equivariant class by the structure theorems. -/
