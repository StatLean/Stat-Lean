# Equivariance — invariance of the risk function

The single structural fact that makes equivariant estimation work: in an invariant
estimation problem the risk function of an equivariant estimator is **constant along the
induced parameter action**. This file proves that fact and its two standard corollaries.

* `risk_smul` — `R(ḡθ, δ) = R(θ, δ)` for every `g` in the acting group;
* `risk_const_of_pretransitive` — when the induced action on `Θ` is transitive, the risk
  of an equivariant estimator does not depend on `θ` at all, so "uniformly minimize the
  risk over the equivariant class" collapses to "minimize one number";
* `risk_const_on_orbit` — without transitivity one still gets constancy on each orbit.

**Reference.** Classical equivariance theory; original sources in the bibliographic
comments below.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The one-line computation is a change of variables: `P (g • θ) = (P θ).map (g • ·)` by
  model invariance, then `lintegral_map` moves `g` onto the integrand, equivariance turns
  `δ (g • x)` into `g • δ x`, and loss invariance cancels the `g` entirely.
* Because that change of variables goes through `lintegral_map`, measurability of `δ` and
  of each loss slice `L θ` are genuine Lean-side requirements even though the classical
  statement leaves them implicit.
* Instance choice: we require only `MeasurableConstSMul G 𝓧` (each `x ↦ g • x` is
  measurable) rather than the stronger `MeasurableSMul G 𝓧`, which would additionally
  force a `MeasurableSpace G`. Nothing in this development ever integrates over the group.
* Transitivity of the induced action is Mathlib's `MulAction.IsPretransitive G Θ`, and
  orbits are `MulAction.orbit G θ`; no bespoke notion of orbit is introduced.

**Bibliographic comments.** The group-theoretic ("invariance") reduction of a decision
problem originates with G. A. Hunt and C. Stein, *Most stringent tests of statistical
hypotheses* (unpublished manuscript, 1946), whose argument first reached print through
M. A. Girshick and L. J. Savage, "Bayes and minimax estimates for quadratic loss
functions," *Proc. Second Berkeley Symp. Math. Statist. Probab.*, Univ. California Press,
1951, 53–73. Equivariant estimation of location and scale parameters is due to
E. J. G. Pitman, "The estimation of the location and scale parameters of a continuous
population of any given form," *Biometrika* **30** (1939), 391–421.

/-- **Risk invariance under the induced parameter action.** In an estimation problem
invariant under a group `G` — the model intertwines the data and parameter actions and
the loss is unchanged by the simultaneous action — the risk function of any equivariant
estimator satisfies `R(g • θ, δ) = R(θ, δ)`.

This is the structural reason the equivariance principle reduces a risk *function* to a
risk *number*: see `risk_const_of_pretransitive`. -/

/-- **Constant risk under a transitive induced action.** If the induced action on the
parameter space is transitive, the risk function of an equivariant estimator is a
constant: it takes the same value at any two parameter points. Minimizing the risk
*uniformly* over the equivariant class therefore becomes minimizing a single number,
which is what makes a minimum risk equivariant estimator a reasonable thing to ask for. -/
