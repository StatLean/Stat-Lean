# The minimum risk equivariant location estimator

Putting together the two halves of the theory: the equivariant class is exactly
`{δ₀ − v ∘ diffs}` (`LocationStructure`), and minimizing over such a class reduces to a
fibrewise minimization against the conditional distribution of the data given the
differences (`ConditionalRiskEngine`). The result is the construction of the minimum risk
equivariant (MRE) location estimator.

* `isLocMRE_of_conditional_min` — the construction: if `v*(y)` minimizes the conditional
  expected loss `E₀[ρ(δ₀(X) − v) | y]` in almost every fibre of the differences, then
  `δ₀ − v* ∘ diffs` is MRE;
* `exists_isLocMRE_of_convex` — existence for convex, non-monotone losses;
* `isLocMRE_sq_of_condMean` — squared error: the minimizer is the conditional mean,
  giving `δ*(X) = δ₀(X) − E₀[δ₀(X) | Y]`;
* `exists_isLocMRE_of_bounded_loss` — a single observation and a bounded loss vanishing
  at the origin's antipodes: an MRE estimator exists even though the loss is not convex.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and G. Casella, *Theory of Point Estimation*, 2nd ed.,
Springer-Verlag New York, 1998 (ISBN 0-387-98502-6), Chapter 3 (Equivariance), §3.1 (First
Examples), Theorem 1.10 (the MRE estimator via conditional minimization given the differences)
and Corollary 1.11 (existence for a convex non-monotone loss). (`TPE2 §3.1 Thm 1.10, Cor
1.11`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The conditional distribution of the data given the differences is written through the
  shared `orbitCondKernel (locationBase f) diffs`, whose argument order is pinned in
  `ConditionalRiskEngine`; the template is `F w x = δ₀ x − w`.
* The classical hypothesis is "for each `y` there exists a minimizing `v(y)`"; the proof
  only ever uses it on a set of full measure (the same source observes that the
  conditional risk is finite only almost everywhere), so `hmin` is stated with `∀ᵐ`.
  This weakens the hypothesis and hence strengthens the theorem.
* Measurability of `v*` is a Lean-side requirement absent from the classical statement:
  without it `δ₀ − v* ∘ diffs` need not be an estimator at all. For the convex case the
  intended route to a *measurable* selection is the convex-minimizer and measurable-argmin
  bricks in this area's `ForMathlib` layer; this file states existence and does not
  depend on them.
* Non-monotonicity of a convex loss is spelled out as "neither monotone nor antitone",
  which for a convex function is exactly the condition guaranteeing that a minimum is
  attained rather than approached at `±∞`.
* The classical companion to the squared-error corollary characterises the minimizer for
  absolute error as any conditional median; that variant is not formalized here, since
  the median has no canonical measurable selection to state it with.
* The bounded-loss existence result needs no separate finite-risk hypothesis: a loss
  bounded by `M` gives every estimator risk at most `M` under a probability law.
* **The bounded-loss proof does not go through the conditional-risk engine.** For a single
  observation equivariance pins the estimator down completely — `δ(x) = δ(0) + x₀`, read off
  by evaluating `δ(x + a·𝟙) = δ(x) + a` at `x = 0` — so the equivariant class is literally
  `{x ↦ x₀ − c : c ∈ ℝ}` and the problem is the one-dimensional minimization of
  `G c = ∫⁻ ofReal (ρ (x₀ − c))`. `G` is bounded by `ofReal M` and, by dominated convergence
  against the constant `M`, tends to `ofReal M` along `cocompact ℝ`; so either `G` is
  constant (any `c` minimizes) or some `G c₀` is strictly below the bound and
  `Continuous.exists_forall_le'` attains the minimum. The delicate input is continuity of
  `G`, where the a.e. continuity of the density enters: substituting `x ↦ x + c·𝟙` moves the
  shift off the loss and onto the density, and the shifted densities converge pointwise a.e.
  with constant total mass. There is no dominating function for them, so ordinary dominated
  convergence fails; `tendsto_lintegral_mul_of_tendsto_of_mass_eq` supplies the missing
  uniform integrability from the equal masses (Scheffé's argument). A measurable version of
  `f` is needed for that, and is obtained from `hcont`: the continuity set of any function is
  `Gδ`, hence measurable, and `f` is continuous on it.

**Bibliographic comments.** The reduction of best equivariant location estimation to a
conditional minimization given the differences, and the resulting estimator, are due to
E. J. G. Pitman, "The estimation of the location and scale parameters of a continuous
population of any given form," *Biometrika* **30** (1939), 391–421. The admissibility of
that estimator was established by C. Stein, "The admissibility of Pitman's estimator of a
single location parameter," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **30** (1959), 970–979.

converge pointwise almost everywhere to `h₀` and all carry the same finite total mass, then
integrals against a bounded test function converge. Pointwise convergence alone is not

/-- **A single observation and a bounded loss.** For one observation the equivariant
estimators are exactly `X − c`, so an MRE estimator exists as soon as
`c ↦ E₀[ρ(X − c)]` attains its infimum. That happens for a loss which is bounded, tends
to its bound at `±∞`, and is faced with an almost-everywhere continuous density — a case
where the loss need not be convex at all.

No finite-risk hypothesis is needed: a loss bounded by `M` gives every estimator risk at
