# A family with no nontrivial invariance

The equivariance principle is only available when the model admits symmetries. This file
exhibits a family for which it is not: the **power series family** on `ℕ`,

`P_θ{X = k} = c_k θ^k h(θ)`,   `k = 0, 1, 2, …`,  `θ > 0`,

with all coefficients `c_k` strictly positive. For such a family the *only* bijection of
the sample space leaving the family invariant is the identity, so the invariance group is
trivial and the equivariance principle has no content.

* `powerSeriesFamily` — the family, as a density with respect to the counting measure on
  `ℕ`, normalized by the total sum;
* `powerSeriesFamily_invariant_affine` — the structural step: an invariance-preserving
  bijection has constant successive increments;
* `powerSeriesFamily_invariant_perm_eq_one` — the conclusion: such a bijection is the
  identity;
* `powerSeriesFamily_invariantPerms_eq_singleton` — the same statement packaged as "the
  set of invariance-preserving permutations is `{1}`".

**Reference.** Classical equivariance theory; original sources in the bibliographic
comments below.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The classical conclusion really is the general "the transformation is the identity"
  claim (not a two-point comparison), so it is transcribed as such, with the bijection
  modelled as `Equiv.Perm ℕ`.
* The argument runs as follows. Write `a_k = g(k)`. Matching point masses gives
  `c_k θ^k h(θ) = c_{a_k} μ^{a_k} h(μ)` for the transported parameter `μ`; taking ratios
  of consecutive `k` twice shows `μ^{a_{k+2} − a_{k+1}}` is proportional to
  `μ^{a_{k+1} − a_k}` *throughout an interval of `μ`*, whence the exponents agree and
  `a_k = a_0 + kΔ`. Being a permutation of `ℕ` forces `Δ = 1` and `a_0 = 0`.
* Because the exponent-matching step needs `μ` to range over an interval, the parameter
  set is taken to be an interval `Ioo 0 R` on which the series converges, rather than the
  informal "`0 < θ < ∞`". The increments are recorded in `ℤ`, since `ℕ`-subtraction would
  truncate and the increments are not known to be nonnegative before the final step.
* The strict positivity of every coefficient is essential and not cosmetic: when
  `c_k = 0` for all `k` beyond some threshold the conclusion fails — the binomial family
  is invariant under `k ↦ n − k`, whose induced parameter map is `p ↦ 1 − p`.
* Edge behaviour of `powerSeriesFamily`: the normalizer is the total sum
  `∑' j, c_j θ^j`, so the definition returns the zero measure where the series diverges
  and the junk `∞`-valued density where it vanishes. Theorems carry the convergence
  hypothesis.

**Bibliographic comments.** The group-theoretic framework in which "the model admits no
nontrivial symmetries" is the relevant negative statement is due to G. A. Hunt and
C. Stein (unpublished manuscript, 1946), first reported in print by M. A. Girshick and
L. J. Savage, "Bayes and minimax estimates for quadratic loss functions," *Proc. Second
Berkeley Symp. Math. Statist. Probab.*, Univ. California Press, 1951, 53–73.

/-- The **power series family** on `ℕ` with coefficients `a`: the law with density
`k ↦ a k · θ^k / ∑' j, a j · θ^j` with respect to the counting measure.

The normalizer is the total sum, so this is a probability measure exactly where that sum
is finite and nonzero; elsewhere the definition takes the junk value coming from
`ℝ≥0∞`-division (zero measure when the sum is infinite, `∞`-valued density when it
vanishes). Theorems carry the corresponding convergence hypotheses. -/

/-- Analytic core of `powerSeriesFamily_invariant_affine`: density matching plus the
coefficient-ratio / exponent arithmetic-progression argument.

Matching point masses of `(P θ).map g = P θ'` gives, for every `k`,
`a k · θ^k / Z(θ) = a (g k) · θ'^(g k) / Z(θ')`. Passing to positive reals and taking
`log`, the equation for index `k` minus that for index `0` reads
`(log Rₖ − log R₀) + k·log θ = (log R_{gk} − log R_{g0}) + (gk − g0)·log θ'`,
where `Rᵢ = (a i).toReal`. Eliminating `log θ'` between the relations for indices `k` and
`1` (a linear combination) yields `(e·k − (gk−g0))·log θ = C` with `e = g1 − g0` and `C`
independent of `θ`; as this holds throughout the interval, `e·k = gk − g0`, i.e.
`gk = g0 + k·e`, so `g(k+1) − gk = e` is constant. -/
