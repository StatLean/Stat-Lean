# Risk-unbiasedness of minimum risk equivariant estimators

An estimator is **risk-unbiased** when, on the average, it is at least as close to the
true parameter value as to any false one: `E_θ L(θ, δ(X)) ≤ E_θ L(θ', δ(X))` for every
`θ' ≠ θ`. This is the decision-theoretic extension of unbiasedness — under squared error
it reduces to ordinary unbiasedness, under absolute error to median-unbiasedness.

This file proves that minimum risk equivariant estimators are risk-unbiased, in the
general group setting and in the concrete location setting.

* `isRiskUnbiased_of_equivariant_min` — general form: a transitive induced action on the
  parameter space together with a **commutative** action on the decision space forces a
  risk-minimizing equivariant estimator to be risk-unbiased.
* `isLocRiskUnbiased_of_isLocMRE` / `isRiskUnbiased_of_isLocMRE` — the location
  specialization, where both hypotheses hold automatically (translations act transitively
  on `ℝ` and commutatively on the decisions).
* `locEquivariant_sub_bias` / `integral_eq_zero_of_isLocMRE_sq` — the squared-error
  refinement: recentring an equivariant estimator at its (constant) bias keeps it
  equivariant, makes it unbiased, and strictly improves the risk, whence a
  finite-risk MRE estimator is unbiased.

Both hypotheses of the general theorem are genuinely needed: dropping transitivity or
commutativity produces counterexamples, both of which are exhibited classically by the
normal location-scale problem with a standardized squared-error loss.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and G. Casella, *Theory of Point Estimation*, 2nd ed.,
Springer-Verlag New York, 1998 (ISBN 0-387-98502-6), Chapter 3 (Equivariance), §3.1 (First
Examples), Lemma 1.23, Definition 1.24 (risk-unbiasedness) and Theorem 1.27 (an MRE estimator
for a convex even loss is risk-unbiased). (`TPE2 §3.1 Lem 1.23, Def 1.24, Thm 1.27`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The general proof is three lines and does **not** use model invariance: transitivity
  supplies `g` with `g • θ' = θ`; loss invariance rewrites `L θ' d` as `L θ (g • d)`;
  commutativity of the decision action makes `x ↦ g • δ x` equivariant, so the
  minimality hypothesis applies to it. We therefore state the sharper form, **omitting**
  the invariant-model hypothesis that the classical statement carries. Model invariance
  is what makes the minimality hypothesis `hmin` the natural notion of MRE in the first
  place, but it is not used in the implication.
* `hmin` is stated as an explicit hypothesis rather than through a bundled `IsMRE`
  predicate: the general setting has no canonical constant risk to minimize until
  transitivity has been used, and quantifying over measurable equivariant competitors is
  what the proof consumes.
* In the location case the proof is even shorter and needs no convexity or symmetry of
  the loss: `δ − a` is equivariant whenever `δ` is, so minimality applied to `δ − a`
  *is* risk-unbiasedness. We state that honest form; convexity and evenness of the loss
  enter only the *unbiasedness* (rather than risk-unbiasedness) statements.
* The classical squared-error statement deduces unbiasedness of the MRE estimator from
  its *uniqueness*; the argument in fact needs only finiteness of its risk, which is what
  `integral_eq_zero_of_isLocMRE_sq` assumes. This is a (weakening) deviation.
* The classical third part of the squared-error lemma — an equivariant UMVU estimator is
  MRE — is deliberately omitted here: it belongs to a file that may import the UMVU
  layer, which this area's layering forbids at the equivariance level.

**Bibliographic comments.** Risk-unbiasedness as the decision-theoretic generalization of
unbiasedness is due to E. L. Lehmann, "A general concept of unbiasedness," *Ann. Math.
Statist.* **22** (1951), 587–592. The equivariance framework in which it is proved here
originates with G. A. Hunt and C. Stein (unpublished manuscript, 1946), first reported by
M. A. Girshick and L. J. Savage, "Bayes and minimax estimates for quadratic loss
functions," *Proc. Second Berkeley Symp. Math. Statist. Probab.*, Univ. California Press,
1951, 53–73; the location case goes back to E. J. G. Pitman, "The estimation of the
location and scale parameters of a continuous population of any given form," *Biometrika*
**30** (1939), 391–421.
