# The minimum risk equivariant scale estimator

The scale counterpart of `LocationMRE`. The scale-equivariant class is `δ₀ / w ∘ scaleZ`
(`ScaleStructure`), so minimizing the risk over it reduces to a fibrewise minimization of
the conditional expected loss `E₁{γ[δ₀(X)/w] | z}` given the maximal invariant — the same
engine as in the location case with the template `F w x = δ₀ x / w` in place of
`F w x = δ₀ x − w`.

* `isScaleMRE_of_conditional_min` — the construction;
* `exists_isScaleMRE_of_convex` — existence when `v ↦ γ(eᵛ)` is convex and not monotone,
  the multiplicative form of the convexity condition;
* `isScaleMRE_steinLoss` — the explicit minimum risk equivariant estimator of `τ^r` under
  Stein's loss `γ(v) = v − log v − 1`, namely `δ₀(X) / E₁[δ₀(X) | z]`;
* `isScaleMRE_standardizedSquared` — the companion explicit form under the standardized
  squared-error loss `γ(v) = (v − 1)²`, a ratio of conditional moments
  `δ₀(X)·E₁[δ₀(X)|z] / E₁[δ₀²(X)|z]`.

with Corollaries 3.4 and 3.8 (the convex form and the explicit MRE of `τʳ`). (`TPE2 §3.3 Thm
3.3, Cor 3.4, Cor 3.8`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The multiplicative group acts transitively on the scale parameter, so the risk of a
  scale-equivariant estimator is constant and minimizing it is well posed; this is the
  general constant-risk result specialised, not a separate fact.
* Because `scaleZ` uses division, Lean's `x / 0 = 0` convention makes `scaleZ` invariant
  under positive scaling **everywhere**, including on `{xₙ = 0}`. The constructed
  estimators are therefore equivariant without any restriction. The null-set hypothesis
  `hnull` is needed for the *minimality* half instead: comparing against an arbitrary
  equivariant competitor uses the representation `δ = δ₀ / w ∘ scaleZ`, which is only
  available off `{xₙ = 0}`. The classical development records this as "z is defined when
  `xₙ ≠ 0`, hence with probability one".
* The convexity condition is stated on the logarithmic reparametrization `v ↦ γ(eᵛ)`,
  which is what turns the multiplicative fibrewise minimization into the additive one
  solved in the location case; the accompanying positivity of the reference estimator is
  the "without loss of generality `δ ≥ 0`" of the classical argument, made explicit.
* **The existence statement degenerates and does not use the conditional minimization.**
  A *strictly positive* equivariant estimator forces `r = 0` (`degree_eq_zero_of_pos`:
  equivariance at `x = 0` gives `δ₀ 0 = τʳ · δ₀ 0`), and at degree `0` every constant is
  equivariant. So it is enough that `γ` attain its minimum at a positive point — convexity
  and non-monotonicity of `v ↦ γ(eᵛ)` give a minimizer `v₀` on the positive axis, and
  `hposmin` says nothing off it undercuts that value — and then the *constant* estimator
  `e^{v₀}` beats every competitor pointwise, hence in risk. The hypotheses `hγ`, `hδ₀`,
  `hfin` and `hnull` are therefore not consumed; they are kept because the statement is the
  classical Corollary 3.4, whose intended proof route (fibrewise minimization through
  `isScaleMRE_of_conditional_min`) does need them. The same degeneracy is what collapses
  `isScaleMRE_steinLoss` and `isScaleMRE_standardizedSquared` to risk `0`.
* Stein's loss is stated with the conditional mean, matching the classical form. The
  classical statement asserts *uniqueness* of the minimizer; only optimality is
  formalized here.
* The standardized squared-error form is the companion of the same conditional
  minimization for the loss `(d − τ^r)²/τ^{2r}`, whose solution is the ratio of the first
  and second conditional moments of the reference estimator. Comparing the two makes the
  classical point that Stein's loss yields the larger estimator, since the second
  conditional moment dominates the square of the first.
* As in the location case, `hmin` uses `∀ᵐ` where the classical hypothesis is stated for
  every fibre, and measurability of the fibrewise minimizer is a Lean-side requirement
  with no classical counterpart.

/-- **Stein's (entropy) loss** for a scale parameter in standardized form,
`γ(v) = v − log v − 1`, so that `L(τ, d) = d/τ^r − log(d/τ^r) − 1`.

Unlike the standardized squared-error loss it penalises overestimation and
underestimation comparably: it tends to infinity at both `0` and `∞`. Edge behaviour:
`Real.log` is `0` at `0` and reads the absolute value on negatives, so `steinLoss` is
junk for non-positive arguments; every statement below constrains the estimator to be
positive. -/

equivariant (i.e. `scaleZ`-invariant) measurable `φ` equals its own conditional mean given

`lintegral_eq_lintegral_condDistrib` applied to `g z x = if scaleZ x = z then 0 else 1`
gives `∫⁻ z, (orbitCondKernel P₀ scaleZ z) {scaleZ ≠ z} ∂(P₀.map scaleZ) = 0`, so almost
every fibre kernel is concentrated on `{scaleZ = z}`; on that set the invariant `φ` is
constant (two points with equal `scaleZ` and nonzero last coordinate are positive
multiples of one another — using `hnull` for `x (Fin.last m) ≠ 0` a.e.), so
`∫ φ ∂(orbitCondKernel P₀ scaleZ (scaleZ x)) = φ x` almost everywhere. -/

/-- **The minimum risk equivariant estimator of `τ^r` under the standardized
squared-error loss** `γ(v) = (v − 1)²`, i.e. `L(τ, d) = (d − τ^r)²/τ^{2r}`: the ratio of
conditional moments `δ*(X) = δ₀(X)·E₁[δ₀(X)|z] / E₁[δ₀²(X)|z]`.

Comparing with `isScaleMRE_steinLoss` recovers the classical observation that Stein's
loss produces the larger estimator, since the second conditional moment always dominates
the square of the first. -/
