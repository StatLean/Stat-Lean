# Conditional expectation and determinations of `P(A ∣ T)` under a `T`-measurable tilt

Three bricks relating a statistic `T : 𝓧 → S`, the σ-algebra `MeasurableSpace.comap T` it
generates, and reweighting of the underlying measure by a density that is measurable with
respect to that σ-algebra:

* `map_restrict_eq_withDensity_map` — a θ-free determination `κA` of `P(A ∣ T = ·)` is
  literally a density of the pushed-forward restricted measure: `(μ.restrict A).map T` equals
  `(μ.map T).withDensity κA`. This is the identification that turns the per-event definition
  of sufficiency into a Radon–Nikodym statement on the sample space of the statistic.
* `setLIntegral_comp_withDensity_comap_eq` — **the same** `κA` remains a determination after
  the base measure is tilted by a `T`-measurable density. This is what makes sufficiency a
  property of the *family*: the members of a dominated family differ from one another by
  exactly such tilts once the densities factor through `T`.
* `condExp_withDensity_comap_ae_eq` — the vector-valued counterpart: conditional expectation
  given `σ(T)` is unchanged by a `T`-measurable tilt.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and G. Casella, *Theory of Point Estimation*, 2nd ed.,
Springer-Verlag New York, 1998 (ISBN 0-387-98502-6), Chapter 1 (Preparations), §1.6
(Sufficient Statistics), supporting material for the factorization criterion: conditional
expectations and determinations of `P(A ∣ T)` under a `T`-measurable tilt. (`TPE2 §1.6`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* **Densities are taken in composed form `g ∘ T`.** Every `MeasurableSpace.comap T`-measurable
  function into `ℝ≥0∞` is of this form (the factorization lemma for comap-measurable
  functions), so nothing is lost, while the statements stay first-order and the proofs avoid
  a factorization step in every application. Callers holding an abstract comap-measurable
  density factor it once, at the call site.
* **Route for `map_restrict_eq_withDensity_map`.** Both sides are measures on `S`; test them
  on a measurable `B`. The left side is `μ (A ∩ T ⁻¹' B)` by `Measure.map_apply` and
  `Measure.restrict_apply`, the right side is `∫⁻ x in T ⁻¹' B, κA (T x) ∂μ` by
  `setLIntegral_map` (`withDensity` against a pushforward). The defining property of a
  determination says these agree, and `Measure.ext` closes. No σ-finiteness is needed.
* **Route for `setLIntegral_comp_withDensity_comap_eq`.** Verify first for `g` an indicator
  `Set.indicator B' 1`, where both sides reduce to the defining property at `B ∩ B'`; extend
  by linearity to simple functions and by monotone convergence
  (`lintegral_iSup` / `SimpleFunc.lintegral_eq_lintegral`) to general measurable `g`. No
  finiteness assumption on `g` is required because the whole argument lives in `ℝ≥0∞`.
* **Route for `condExp_withDensity_comap_ae_eq`.** `condExp m μ f` is `m`-measurable and, for
  `m`-measurable `h ≥ 0` with the relevant products integrable, satisfies
  `∫ x in E, condExp m μ f · h ∂μ = ∫ x in E, f · h ∂μ` for `m`-measurable `E`
  ("pulling out what is known"). Taking `h = g ∘ T` and `E = T ⁻¹' B` exhibits `condExp m μ f`
  as a version of the conditional expectation under `μ.withDensity (g ∘ T)`; a.e.-uniqueness
  of conditional expectation gives the conclusion.
* **Regularity carried deliberately.** Two `SigmaFinite (·.trim hT.comap_le)` instances (one
  per measure) are the standing side conditions of Mathlib's `condExp` — without them
  `condExp` is junk-valued `0` and the statement, while still true, would be vacuous.
  A.e.-finiteness of the density `g ∘ T` is likewise genuine regularity, not laundering: the
  conclusion is false for a density that is `∞` on a set of positive measure. Integrability
  of `f` is assumed against **both** measures because neither implies the other and `condExp`
  degenerates to `0` when it fails.

**Bibliographic comments.** Conditional expectation with respect to a σ-algebra, and the
identification of conditional probabilities with Radon–Nikodym derivatives, are due to
A. N. Kolmogorov (*Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung*, Springer, 1933, Ch. V);
the systematic development used here, including the "pulling out what is known" identity, is
J. L. Doob's (*Stochastic Processes*, Wiley, 1953, Ch. I).
