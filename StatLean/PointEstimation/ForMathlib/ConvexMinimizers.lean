# Minimizers of convex integral criteria on the line

The optimization facts behind conditional-risk minimization on the real line:

* `lintegral_convex_even_min_at_zero` — for a convex even `ρ` and a symmetric measure, the
  shifted criterion `c ↦ ∫⁻ ρ (x - c)` is minimized at `c = 0`;
* `exists_min_of_convexOn_of_coercive` — a convex coercive real function on `ℝ` attains its
  minimum;
* `argmin_unique_of_strictConvexOn` — a strictly convex function has at most one minimizer;
* `integral_sq_sub_eq_variance_add_sq` — the bias–variance identity
  `E (X − c)² = E (X − E X)² + (E X − c)²`;
* `integral_sq_sub_mean_le` — its immediate corollary: the mean minimizes squared error.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and G. Casella, *Theory of Point Estimation*, 2nd ed.,
Springer-Verlag New York, 1998 (ISBN 0-387-98502-6), Chapter 3 (Equivariance), §3.1 (First
Examples), supporting material for Theorem 1.10 and Corollary 1.11: minimizers of convex
integral criteria on the line. (`TPE2 §3.1 Thm 1.10, Cor 1.11`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* **`lintegral_convex_even_min_at_zero` is stated for an ARBITRARY measure.** The argument is
  purely `∫⁻`-level: convexity gives the pointwise bound
  `ρ x ≤ ½ ρ (x - c) + ½ ρ (x + c)`, monotonicity and additivity of the lower Lebesgue
  integral turn it into `∫⁻ ρ ≤ ½ ∫⁻ ρ (· - c) + ½ ∫⁻ ρ (· + c)`, and symmetry of the measure
  identifies the two right-hand integrals. Nothing in this chain needs finiteness of `μ` or
  of any of the integrals — `ℝ≥0∞` absorbs the `⊤` cases — so no finiteness hypothesis is
  imposed. Only measurability of `ρ` is required, for additivity of `∫⁻`.
* **Convexity coefficients.** The `∫⁻` statement uses `ConvexOn ℝ≥0`, the only convexity
  predicate that typechecks for `ℝ≥0∞`-valued functions at this pin (`ℝ≥0∞` is a module over
  `ℝ≥0`, not over `ℝ`). The real-valued statements use the ordinary `ConvexOn ℝ`.
* **No continuity hypothesis on `exists_min_of_convexOn_of_coercive`.** A convex function
  `ℝ → ℝ` defined on all of `ℝ` is automatically continuous, so assuming continuity would be
  assuming something forced by the other hypotheses. Coercivity is `Tendsto g (cocompact ℝ)
  atTop`, which for an `ℝ`-valued objective is the intended "blows up at infinity"; the
  `ℝ≥0∞`-valued counterpart lives in `ForMathlib/MeasurableArgmin.lean`, where the target
  filter must be `𝓝 ⊤` instead (in `ℝ≥0∞`, `atTop = pure ⊤`).
* **`integral_sq_sub_mean_le` hypothesizes only the second moment.** Integrability of `X`
  itself is *derived* from `MemLp X 2 μ` on a probability measure, so listing it as a
  hypothesis would be laundering a forced condition. The same applies to integrability of
  `(X - c)²`, which follows from `MemLp.integrable_sq` after adding the constant.
* The bias–variance identity is stated as an equation on Bochner integrals rather than in
  terms of `ProbabilityTheory.variance`, so that it applies to conditional laws presented as
  arbitrary probability measures without a variance-API detour.

**Bibliographic comments.** The convexity inequality underlying the first three statements is
J. L. W. V. Jensen's ("Sur les fonctions convexes et les inégalités entre les valeurs
moyennes," *Acta Math.* **30** (1906), 175–193). That the mean minimizes mean squared error,
and the accompanying decomposition of the error, go back to C. F. Gauss's least-squares
memoir (*Theoria combinationis observationum erroribus minimis obnoxiae*, Göttingen, 1821).
