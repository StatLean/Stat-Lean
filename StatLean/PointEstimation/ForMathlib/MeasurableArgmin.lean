# A measurable selection of minimizers of a parametrized convex scan

Given a family `f : Ω → ℝ → ℝ≥0∞` of convex, continuous, coercive functions of a real scan
variable, depending measurably on a parameter `ω`, there is a **measurable** map
`u : Ω → ℝ` picking a minimizer of `f ω` for every `ω`.

* `iInf_eq_iInf_rat_of_continuous` — a continuous `ℝ≥0∞`-valued function has the same
  infimum over `ℝ` as over `ℚ`;
* `exists_forall_le_of_continuous_of_coercive` — a continuous coercive function attains its
  infimum;
* `exists_measurable_argmin` — the measurable selection (continuous form);
* `exists_measurable_argmin_of_convex_of_finite` / `exists_measurable_argmin_of_convex` — the
  **convex** strengthening: continuity is replaced by lower semicontinuity, at the cost of a
  single finiteness point `f ω 0 < ⊤` (everywhere, resp. almost everywhere). This is what the
  conditional-risk consumers use, since an unbounded convex loss makes the objective jump to
  `∞` and the plain-continuity form does not apply.

This is the brick that makes "minimize the conditional risk pointwise, then read the answer
off as an estimator" legitimate: the pointwise minimizer must be a *measurable* function of
the conditioning variable before it can be called an estimator at all.

**On the lower-semicontinuous strengthening.** A *naive* weakening of `hcont` to plain
`LowerSemicontinuous (f ω)` is FALSE for the rational-relaxed-sublevel construction: a convex
lsc objective can be finite at a single *irrational* point (its finiteness domain a
singleton), where the minimum is invisible to the rationals, so `⨅ q : ℚ, f ω q ≠ ⨅ v, f ω v`
and measurability of `M` breaks. Convexity together with **one finiteness point** `f ω 0 < ⊤`
rules out exactly this pathology — the domain is then a nondegenerate (or singleton-at-`0`)
interval containing `0`, on whose rationals the infimum is approached from the `0`-side by the
convexity inequality (`convex_iInf_le_aux`), no continuity required. The consumers get their
finiteness point from the finite-risk hypothesis via disintegration.

Examples), supporting material for Theorem 1.10 and Corollary 1.11: a measurable selection of
minimizers of a parametrized convex scan. (`TPE2 §3.1 Thm 1.10, Cor 1.11`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* **Continuity, not lower semicontinuity — deliberate.** The natural hypothesis for a
  measurable-argmin theorem is lower semicontinuity in the scan variable, and the statement
  below does hold in that generality. Continuity is assumed instead because it keeps the
  selection *elementarily* provable: the relaxed sublevel sets can be tested on rationals
  (see the next item), whereas the lower semicontinuous version routes through a genuine
  selection theorem. Weakening `hcont` to `LowerSemicontinuous (f ω)` is a strengthening that
  can be made later without touching any call site.
* **Rational-relaxed-sublevel selection.** Take `u ω` to be the *leftmost* minimizer,
  `u ω = sInf {v | f ω v = ⨅ w, f ω w}` (nonempty by
  `exists_forall_le_of_continuous_of_coercive`, closed by continuity, bounded below by
  coercivity, and an interval by convexity). Measurability follows from
  `u ω < r ↔ ∃ q : ℚ, (q : ℝ) < r ∧ ⨅ v ∈ Set.Iic (q : ℝ), f ω v = ⨅ v, f ω v`, where each
  relativized infimum is again a countable infimum over rationals by the density argument of
  `iInf_eq_iInf_rat_of_continuous`. Every set on the right is measurable because `f` is
  jointly measurable, and the union is countable.
* `iInf_eq_iInf_rat_of_continuous` is stated globally over `ℝ`; the selection proof uses the
  same density argument relativized to `Set.Iic q`, which is the special case of
  `⨅ x ∈ closure s, g x = ⨅ x ∈ s, g x` for continuous `g`.
* **Convexity is `ConvexOn ℝ≥0 Set.univ`.** For an `ℝ≥0∞`-valued function this is the only
  convexity predicate that typechecks at this pin: `ConvexOn 𝕜` needs `SMul 𝕜 ℝ≥0∞`, and
  `ℝ≥0∞` is a module over `ℝ≥0` but not over `ℝ`. On `[0, ∞]`-valued functions of a real
  variable the `ℝ≥0`-coefficient definition is the usual midpoint-convexity condition, so
  nothing is lost.
* **Coercivity is `Tendsto (f ω) (cocompact ℝ) (𝓝 ⊤)`, not `… atTop`.** In `ℝ≥0∞`,
  `Filter.atTop = pure ⊤` (`OrderTop.atTop_eq`), so the `atTop` phrasing would read "`f ω`
  equals `⊤` off a compact set" — true but useless. The `𝓝 ⊤` form is the intended "`f ω`
  blows up at infinity"; for `ℝ`-valued scans (see `ForMathlib/ConvexMinimizers.lean`) the
  two coincide and `atTop` is used there.
* **Attainment is derived, never hypothesized.** The conclusion asserts
  `f ω (u ω) = ⨅ v, f ω v`, i.e. that the infimum *is attained at the selected point*; it is
  forced by continuity plus coercivity and so must not appear as a hypothesis.

**Bibliographic comments.** Measurable selections of set-valued maps are due to
K. Kuratowski and C. Ryll-Nardzewski ("A general theorem on selectors," *Bull. Acad. Polon.
Sci. Sér. Sci. Math. Astronom. Phys.* **13** (1965), 397–403); the special case of an
argmin selection for a Carathéodory integrand is the standard application of that theorem,
here replaced by the elementary leftmost-minimizer construction.

### The convex (lower-semicontinuous) variant

The `Continuous` hypothesis of `exists_measurable_argmin` cannot simply be weakened to lower
semicontinuity: for a *convex* `ℝ≥0∞`-valued objective the finiteness domain can be a single
irrational point (e.g. `g w = ∫⁻ x, e^{(δ₀ x - w)²/2} dκ` for a heavy fibre `κ` is finite at
exactly one `w`), where the minimum is *not* approached along the rationals, so
`⨅ q : ℚ, g q ≠ ⨅ v, g v` and the rational-relaxed-sublevel measurability of
`exists_measurable_argmin` genuinely breaks. Convexity together with **one finiteness point**
`g 0 < ⊤` rules out exactly this pathology: the finiteness domain is then a nondegenerate (or
singleton-at-`0`) interval containing `0`, on whose rationals the infimum is approached from
the `0`-side by the convexity inequality — no continuity required. This is the exact
regularity the conditional-risk consumers can supply (their finiteness point comes from the
finite-risk hypothesis via disintegration). -/

/-- **Convexity replaces continuity (the density step).** For a convex `ℝ≥0∞`-valued `g`
finite at a base point `r`, any quantity `c` bounded by `g` on the rationals of the open
segment between `r` and `w` (and at `r` itself) is bounded by `g w`: rationals on that segment
approach `w`, and the convexity inequality against the finite `g r` passes to the limit. This
survives the jump to `⊤` at the boundary of the finiteness domain, where continuity fails. -/

convex, lower-semicontinuous, coercive functions of a real scan variable, each **finite at

/-- **Measurable argmin, convex form (almost-everywhere).** The version the conditional-risk
consumers use: a jointly measurable family of convex, lower-semicontinuous, coercive functions
of a real scan variable, finite at `0` **for almost every** parameter, admits a measurable
minimizer selection valid almost everywhere. The a.e. finiteness point is exactly what the
finite-risk hypothesis of the location/scale MRE consumers supplies (via disintegration). -/
