# Score identities and elementary properties of the Fisher information

The score of a dominated family is the logarithmic derivative of its density,
`ℓ̇_θ(x) = ∂_θ p_θ(x) / p_θ(x)`, and the information is its second moment. Under
differentiation under the integral sign in the normalisation identity
`∫ p_θ dμ = 1`, the score has mean zero, so the information is exactly the variance
of the score; with one more derivative it is also the negated expected curvature of
the log-likelihood:
$$ E_\theta\bigl[\ell̇_\theta(X)\bigr] = 0,\qquad
   I(\theta) = \operatorname{var}_\theta \ell̇_\theta(X)
             = -E_\theta\Bigl[\tfrac{\partial^2}{\partial\theta^2}\log p_\theta(X)\Bigr]. $$

Contents:
* `HasCommonSupport` — the regularity condition that the positivity set of the density
  does not depend on the parameter (used throughout to control the junk-safe score off
  the support);
* `score_mul_density_eq_deriv` — the identity `ℓ̇_θ · p_θ = ∂_θ p_θ` that makes the
  junk-safe score integrate correctly;
* `integral_score_eq_zero` — the score has mean zero;
* `fisherInfo_eq_variance_score` — the information is the variance of the score;
* `fisherInfo_eq_neg_integral_secondDeriv` — the negated-curvature expression;
* `reparam`, `fisherInfo_reparam` — the information transforms by the squared derivative
  of the reparametrization, `I^{*}(\xi) = I(h(\xi))\,h'(\xi)^2`;
* `fisherInfo_eq_asymptoticStatistics` — the bridge identifying the density-derived
  information with the bilinear Fisher-information form of the asymptotics area,
  evaluated on the derived score.

**Reference.** Classical Fisher-information theory: the mean-zero score identity, the
variance and negated-curvature expressions for the information, and its behavior under
reparametrization. Original sources in the bibliographic comments below.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The score is junk-safe (`0/0 = 0`), so off the support `ℓ̇_θ · p_θ = 0` while
  `∂_θ p_θ` need not vanish; the common-support condition repairs this, because it forces
  `t ↦ p_t(x)` to be identically zero at every `x` outside the support. This is why
  `HasCommonSupport` — a genuine condition of the classical theory, not a Lean artifact —
  appears in every statement that trades the score against the density derivative.
* Differentiation under the integral sign is never derived here: it is an explicit
  `HasDerivAt` hypothesis about the map `t ↦ ∫ p_t dμ` (respectively `t ↦ ∫ ∂_t p_t dμ`),
  which is exactly the classical regularity condition. Sufficient dominated-convergence
  conditions on the family alone are supplied in `InformationInequality.DensityRegularity`.
* `fisherInfo_eq_variance_score` is stated with the model measure `μ.withDensity p_θ`
  (`ParametricFamily.toMeasure`), so that the right-hand side is the variance of the score
  as a random variable under `P_θ`, matching the probabilistic reading.
* The bridge lemma evaluates the asymptotics-area bilinear form at the unit vectors of the
  one-dimensional parameter space; there the real inner product is multiplication, so the
  bilinear form reduces to the second moment of the derived score.

**Bibliographic comments.** The score function and the information it carries were
introduced by R. A. Fisher ("Theory of statistical estimation," *Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc.*
**22** (1925), 700–725), building on his earlier "On the mathematical foundations of
theoretical statistics," *Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A* **222** (1922), 309–368.
The variance and negated-curvature expressions, and the transformation rule under
reparametrization, are part of the systematic treatment in H. Cramér (*Mathematical
Methods of Statistics*, Princeton University Press, 1946, §32.3) and C. R. Rao
("Information and the accuracy attainable in the estimation of statistical parameters,"
*Bull. Calcutta Math. Soc.* **37** (1945), 81–91).

/-! ## The common-support condition -/

/-- The **common-support condition**: the positivity set `{x | p_θ(x) > 0}` of the density
is the same for every parameter value.

This formalizes the classical regularity requirement that the members of the family are
mutually absolutely continuous, so that likelihood ratios and logarithmic derivatives are
defined on one fixed set. Edge behavior: it is vacuously satisfied by families with
everywhere-positive densities, and it is a genuine restriction for families whose support
moves with the parameter (uniform-type families), which is precisely where the information
inequality fails. -/

`∫ ∂_θ p_θ dμ = 0`, and the common-support condition identifies that integrand with
