# Family-side regularity: the information inequality for *every* square-integrable statistic

The information inequality as stated with conditions on the estimator requires, for each
statistic separately, that its expectation may be differentiated under the integral sign.
That condition is undesirable: one would like a hypothesis on the *densities* alone, valid
once and for all. The classical device is a Lipschitz-type domination of the normalized
difference quotients of the density: if there are `ε > 0` and an envelope `b` with
$$ \Bigl|\frac{p_{\theta+\Delta}(x) - p_\theta(x)}{\Delta\, p_\theta(x)}\Bigr| \le b(x)
   \quad\text{for } 0 < |\Delta| < \varepsilon, \qquad E_\theta b^2 < \infty, $$
then Cauchy–Schwarz makes `|δ| b` integrable for every square-integrable `δ`, and dominated
convergence justifies passing the limit inside the integral. Consequently the information
inequality holds for *every* statistic with a finite second moment.

Contents:
* `HasDominatedDifferenceQuotient` — the domination condition on the normalized difference
  quotients of the density;
* `diff_under_integral_of_density_regular` — the dominated-convergence step: the expectation
  of any square-integrable statistic is differentiable, with derivative the covariance of
  the statistic with the score;
* `integral_score_eq_zero_of_density_regular` — the same applied to the constant statistic
  `1`: the mean-zero property of the score is a *consequence* of the domination condition;
* `cramer_rao_of_density_regular` — the information inequality under family-side conditions
  only, valid for every square-integrable statistic;
* `cramer_rao_iid` — the sample-size-`n` form, with `n I(θ)` in the denominator.

**Reference.** Classical family-side (Lipschitz-type) regularity conditions for the
information inequality, replacing the per-estimator differentiation-under-the-integral
condition. Original sources in the bibliographic comments below.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The domination condition is transcribed exactly as the classical one: the envelope `b` is
  required to be square-integrable under `P_θ` and to bound the *normalized* difference
  quotients `(p_{θ+Δ} − p_θ)/(Δ p_θ)` for all small nonzero increments; the bound is imposed
  `P_θ`-almost everywhere, which is where the quotient is meaningful (on the common support
  the denominator does not vanish). No uniformity in `θ` is assumed: the condition is local
  at the parameter value where the inequality is claimed.
* The conclusion of the dominated-convergence step is stated as a `HasDerivAt` of
  `t ↦ ∫ δ p_t dμ` whose value is `∫ δ ℓ̇_θ p_θ dμ`. Since the score has mean zero, that
  value is the covariance of `δ` with the score, which is the classical reading; both
  conclusions of the classical lemma (existence of the derivative, and its identification)
  are therefore contained in this single statement.
* `cramer_rao_of_density_regular` returns a conjunction rather than a bound with the
  derivative supplied as data: under family-side regularity the derivative is not an input
  but a consequence, so it is stated as part of the conclusion. Supplying it as a hypothesis
  would reintroduce exactly the estimator-side condition this theorem exists to remove.
* `cramer_rao_iid` follows the classical route: the information inequality for the sample,
  with the additivity of the information over independent observations substituted in the
  denominator. Its estimator-side conditions are stated for the sample; the family-side
  theorem above, applied to the product family, is what discharges them in applications.

**Bibliographic comments.** Regularity conditions of this Lipschitz type, and the resulting
"holds for all square-integrable estimators" form of the information inequality, are
discussed by H. Cramér (*Mathematical Methods of Statistics*, Princeton University Press,
1946, §32.3) and refined by R. A. Wijsman ("On the attainment of the Cramér–Rao lower
bound," *Ann. Statist.* **1** (1973), 538–542) and V. Fabian and J. Hannan ("On the
Cramér–Rao inequality," *Ann. Statist.* **5** (1977), 197–205), who gave conditions under
which the bound holds and is attained. The additivity used for the sample-size-`n` form is
R. A. Fisher's ("Theory of statistical estimation," *Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc.* **22** (1925),
700–725).

/-- The **dominated-difference-quotient condition** at `θ`: there are a radius `ε > 0` and
an envelope `b`, square-integrable under `P_θ`, such that the normalized difference
quotients of the density satisfy
`|(p_{θ+Δ}(x) − p_θ(x)) / (Δ p_θ(x))| ≤ b(x)` for every increment with `0 < |Δ| < ε`,
`P_θ`-almost everywhere.

This is the classical Lipschitz-type smoothness condition on the family; it is what makes
dominated convergence available uniformly in the estimator. Edge behavior: the bound is
imposed `P_θ`-a.e., so points outside the support impose no constraint (the quotient there
is Lean's junk value `0`), and increments `Δ = 0` are excluded since the quotient is not
defined for them. -/

dominated-difference-quotient condition, the expectation of *any* square-integrable

the statistic with the score, the score being centered.

Cauchy–Schwarz bounds the integrand `|δ| · |difference quotient|` by `|δ| b`, which is
integrable because both factors are square-integrable; dominated convergence then exchanges
the limit and the integral. -/

/-- **The information inequality for an independent identically distributed sample.** For a
sample of size `n ≥ 1` the information in the sample is `n I(θ)`, so the bound on the
variance of a statistic `δ` of the whole sample is
`(∂_θ E_θ δ)² / (n I(θ)) ≤ var_θ(δ)`.

The conditions on the sample statistic are the estimator-side ones (finite second moment,
and differentiation under the integral sign for its expectation); the family-side theorem
above, applied to the `n`-fold product family, is what discharges them in applications. -/
