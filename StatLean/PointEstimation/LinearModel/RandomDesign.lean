# Regression coefficients and random designs

In the regression form of the linear model the mean vector is `ξ = θ A` for a known design
matrix `A` of full row rank; the least-squares estimator of the coefficient vector is
`θ̂(y) = y Aᵀ (A Aᵀ)⁻¹`. This file records:

* `designMean`, `designSpace`, `lseCoeff`, `regressionModel` — the regression form and its
  least-squares estimator, together with the bridge `designMean_lseCoeff` identifying
  `θ̂` with the least-squares estimator of the mean vector;
* `isUMVU_regression_coeff` — every linear function of `θ̂` is UMVU for the corresponding
  linear function of `θ`;
* `covariance_regression_coeff` — the covariance matrix of `θ̂` is `σ² (A Aᵀ)⁻¹`;
* `not_exists_blue_of_known_design_moment` — when the design is itself random with a law
  whose second moment `E(A Aᵀ)` is known, no best linear unbiased estimator exists
  (DEFERRAL-ELIGIBLE, see below).

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and G. Casella, *Theory of Point Estimation*, 2nd ed.,
Springer-Verlag New York, 1998 (ISBN 0-387-98502-6), Chapter 3 (Equivariance), §3.4 (Normal
Linear Models), Theorem 4.14 (the regression-coefficient form and its covariance). (`TPE2 §3.4
Thm 4.14`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* *Row convention.* Coefficient vectors multiply the design on the left, `ξ = θ A` with `A`
  of size `s × n`, matching `Matrix.vecMul`; `lseCoeff` is the total function
  `y ↦ y Aᵀ (A Aᵀ)⁻¹`, which is junk (zero) when `A A ᵀ` is singular, i.e. exactly when the
  full-row-rank hypothesis fails.
* *Measurable carrier for a random design.* `Matrix` is a non-reducible definition and
  carries no `MeasurableSpace` instance, so a random design is carried by the plain
  function type `DesignSample s n = Fin s → Fin n → ℝ` (product measurable structure) and
  read as a matrix through `Matrix.of`.
* *Random-design model.* The joint law of design and response is `Q ⊗ₘ K p`: a fixed design
  law `Q` (the same under every parameter) and a Markov kernel `K p` giving the conditional
  law of the response, constrained only through its conditional mean and covariance. This
  keeps the moments-only spirit of the fixed-design theorem while making "expectations are
  taken over the joint distribution" precise.
* *The nonexistence clause is a planned debt.* Its classical proof is delegated to
  exercises, and the printed statement omits the nondegeneracy needed to make it true — for
  an almost surely constant design the fixed-design theorem *does* provide a best linear
  unbiased estimator. The statement below therefore carries an explicit nondegeneracy
  hypothesis on the design law; whether that hypothesis is exactly the right one is part of
  the deferred content, and the statement is to be renegotiated when the debt is closed.

**Bibliographic comments.** The regression form of the linear model and the covariance
formula `σ²(A Aᵀ)⁻¹` are classical, going back to C. F. Gauss (*Theoria combinationis
observationum erroribus minimis obnoxiae*, 1821/1823) and A. A. Markov
(*Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung*, Teubner, 1912); see H. Scheffé (*The Analysis of Variance*,
Wiley, 1959), W. Kruskal ("When are Gauss–Markov and least squares estimators identical?"
in *Essays in Probability and Statistics*, 1965) and C. R. Rao (*Linear Statistical
Inference and Its Applications*, 2nd ed., Wiley, 1973). The failure of best linear unbiased
estimation for random regressors with known second moment is due to J. P. Shaffer
("The Gauss–Markov theorem and random regressors," *Amer. Statist.* **45** (1991),
269–273); its relation to ancillarity and admissibility was investigated by L. D. Brown
("An ancillarity paradox which appears in multiple linear regression," *Ann. Statist.*
**18** (1990), 471–493).

DEFERRAL-ELIGIBLE (planned debt): the classical proof of this clause is delegated to
exercises, and the printed statement omits the nondegeneracy that makes it true — for an
almost surely constant design the fixed-design theorem does supply a best linear unbiased
estimator. The nondegeneracy hypothesis below is our reading of the intended scope; if it
turns out to be insufficient the statement is renegotiated when the debt is discharged. -/

  -- SAME `‖a‖²`, so the min-norm bound `‖c(a)‖² ≥ v_a² / ‖a‖²` yields
  --   `variance δ ≥ σ²·(v₁² + v₂²)/(2‖a‖²) + θ²·Var_a(v)`,
  -- and BOTH terms are minimized simultaneously at `v₁ = v₂ = 1`. Hence the conditional
  -- least-squares estimator attains the minimum variance at EVERY `(θ, σ²)` — it is a BLUE,
  -- so `∃ δ, IsBLUERandomDesign …` holds and the negation is false. (When `‖a‖²` varies over
  -- the support of `Q`, the σ²-term and the θ²-term are minimized at different `v`, and no
  -- BLUE exists — the intended Shaffer phenomenon; a correct hypothesis must rule out the
  -- constant-`‖a‖²` degeneracy, e.g. via nonconstancy of the design Gram/Fisher information.)
  -- Left as documented debt: the printed statement is to be renegotiated per its docstring.
