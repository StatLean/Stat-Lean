# Statistical models and risk — core data model for point estimation

Carrier conventions for the point-estimation area:

* a **statistical model** is a plain family of probability measures `P : Θ → Measure 𝓧`
  (no measurability in `θ` is ever assumed — kernels enter through their coercion);
* `Identifiable P` — distinct parameters give distinct distributions;
* `ParametricFamily.toMeasure M μ θ` — the measure `μ.withDensity (p_θ)` of a dominated
  model, connecting the density-based `ParametricFamily` carrier to measure families;
* `crossRisk P L δ θ θ'` — the expected loss `∫⁻ L θ' (δ x) ∂P θ` of estimating `θ'`'s
  value when data are generated under `θ` (the two-parameter form needed for
  risk-unbiasedness);
* `risk P L δ θ` — the risk function `R(θ, δ) = E_θ L(θ, δ(X))`;
* `riskRand P L κ θ` — the risk of a **randomized** estimator, a Markov kernel
  `κ : 𝓧 ⇝ D`.

**Reference.** Classical statistical decision theory; original sources in the
bibliographic comments below.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* Risks are `ℝ≥0∞`-valued lower Lebesgue integrals (junk-value discipline): a
  non-integrable loss records the genuine value `∞` rather than the Bochner junk `0`,
  so risk inequalities carry real content. Real-valued convex losses enter individual
  theorems through `ENNReal.ofReal`.
* `riskRand` is compatible with the kernel-composition risk shape: for `K : Kernel Θ 𝓧`
  one has `riskRand ⇑K L κ θ = ∫⁻ d, L θ d ∂((κ ∘ₖ K) θ)` (proved where used).
* We deliberately do not bundle `IsProbabilityMeasure` into a structure; it is carried
  as an instance argument `[∀ θ, IsProbabilityMeasure (P θ)]` by consumers, keeping the
  carrier a bare function.

**Bibliographic comments.** The decision-theoretic framing of estimation — loss, risk,
and comparison of estimators by their risk functions — is due to A. Wald (*Statistical
Decision Functions*, Wiley, 1950). Identifiability as a property of the parametrization
is classical folklore; see E. L. Lehmann, "A general concept of unbiasedness," *Ann.
