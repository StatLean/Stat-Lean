# Sufficiency — first consequences of the regular-conditional (kernel) form

This file develops the elementary API of `HasSufficientKernel`, the graph/compProd carrier
of sufficiency fixed in `Sufficiency.Defs`:

* `isProbabilityMeasure_statLaw` — the law of the statistic is a probability measure;
* `isSufficient_of_hasSufficientKernel` — the kernel form implies the per-event form, the
  determination of `P_θ(A ∣ T = t)` being `t ↦ Q t A`;
* `statLaw_snd` — second-marginal (reconstruction) recovery: composing the kernel with the
  law of the statistic returns the original member, `Q ∘ₘ (statLaw P T θ) = P θ`;
* `hasSufficientKernel_fiber` — the kernel is carried by the fibers of `T`:
  `Q t {x | T x = t} = 1` for almost every `t`.

**Reference.** Classical sufficiency theory: the reconstruction property of a sufficient
statistic (data can be regenerated from `T` alone using a θ-free random mechanism) and the
equivalence between the per-event and regular-conditional formulations on nice spaces.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* `statLaw_snd` is stated in the shape dictated by Mathlib's composition API: the relevant
  lemma is `MeasureTheory.Measure.snd_compProd : (μ ⊗ₘ κ).snd = κ ∘ₘ μ`, whose right-hand
  side puts the kernel on the *left* of `∘ₘ`. We therefore state reconstruction as
  `Q ∘ₘ (statLaw P T θ) = P θ` rather than in a `bind`/`∫⁻`-unfolded form; the left side of
  `snd_compProd` is supplied by pushing the graph identity through `Measure.snd`, using
  `snd ∘ (fun x => (T x, x)) = id`.
* `isSufficient_of_hasSufficientKernel` evaluates the graph identity on measurable
  rectangles `B ×ˢ A`: the left side is `P θ (T ⁻¹' B ∩ A)` and the right side is
  `∫⁻ t in B, Q t A ∂(statLaw P T θ)`, which the change of variables for `Measure.map`
  turns into `∫⁻ x in T ⁻¹' B, Q (T x) A ∂(P θ)`. Measurability of `t ↦ Q t A` is
  `Kernel.measurable_coe`, and `Q t A ≤ 1` is the Markov property.
* `hasSufficientKernel_fiber` needs the diagonal `{(t, x) | T x = t} ⊆ S × 𝓧` to be
  measurable; `[StandardBorelSpace S]` supplies `MeasurableSingletonClass S` and countable
  generation, which is what makes that set measurable (via `measurableSet_eq_fun`). The
  fiber statement is the reason the area's carrier is the *graph* compProd form rather than
  the weaker reconstruction identity: reconstruction alone does not pin `Q` to the fibers.

**Bibliographic comments.** Sufficiency and the reconstruction interpretation are due to
R. A. Fisher ("On the mathematical foundations of theoretical statistics," *Phil. Trans. R.
Soc. A* **222** (1922), 309–368). The measure-theoretic treatment of sufficiency for
dominated families, including the passage between per-event determinations and regular
conditional distributions, is due to P. R. Halmos and L. J. Savage ("Application of the
Radon–Nikodym theorem to the theory of sufficient statistics," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **20**
(1949), 225–241); the general decision-theoretic formulation, in which a sufficient
statistic is exactly one admitting a θ-free reconstruction kernel, is due to R. R. Bahadur
("Sufficiency and statistical decision functions," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **25** (1954),
423–462).

`Q ∘ₘ (statLaw P T θ) = P θ`. This is the "regenerate the data from `T` with a θ-free random
mechanism" statement, and it is the second-marginal shadow of the graph identity. -/
