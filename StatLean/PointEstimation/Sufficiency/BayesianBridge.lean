# Bridging the two carriers of sufficiency

Sufficiency is formalized twice in this library, with different carriers suited to different
uses: a bare family of measures `P : Θ → Measure 𝓧` indexed by an unstructured parameter set,
and a Markov kernel `K : Θ ⇝ 𝓧` (a *statistical experiment*), which is what Bayesian arguments
need in order to build joint laws with a prior. This file records that the kernel-form
notions agree:

* `bayesian_isSufficient_of_hasSufficientKernel` — a θ-free disintegration of the graph law
  of `(T, id)` under every member of an experiment gives the reconstruction factorization
  `K = Q ∘ₖ K_T` of the Bayesian carrier;
* `isFactorizedDensity_of_isFactorizedLikelihood` — the pointwise Fisher–Neyman factorization
  of a likelihood implies the almost-everywhere factorization of the densities.

**Reference.** Classical sufficiency theory; the two formulations are the reconstruction
(kernel-factorization) definition and the factorization criterion.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* **Import direction.** This is a bridge file and is the one place where the point-estimation
  area reaches into another area's concept layer. It imports the Bayesian *definitions* only,
  and nothing in the Bayesian area imports it back; the direction of the statements is
  "point-estimation hypothesis ⟹ Bayesian conclusion", so no other file in this area needs
  to depend on it.
* The first bridge is the second-marginal identity: taking `Measure.snd` of the graph
  identity turns `(K θ).map (T, id) = ((K θ).map T) ⊗ₘ Q` into `K θ = Q ∘ₘ ((K θ).map T)`
  (`statLaw_snd`), and `(K θ).map T` is exactly the statistic-induced experiment `K_T` of the
  Bayesian carrier evaluated at `θ`; kernel extensionality finishes. So the graph form is
  strictly stronger, as intended: it also pins the kernel to the fibers of `T`, which the
  bare reconstruction identity does not.
* The second bridge is a weakening, from a pointwise equation to a `μ`-a.e. one, and holds
  for an arbitrary reference measure `μ` with no measurability side conditions. The converse
  is false without further hypotheses, and is not stated.
* No claim is made in the reverse direction (Bayesian sufficiency ⟹ the graph form): that
  implication needs a regular-conditional construction and is exactly the content of
  `Sufficiency.RegularConditional`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The reconstruction formulation of sufficiency — a statistic is
sufficient when the data can be regenerated from it by a parameter-free random mechanism — is
due to R. A. Fisher ("On the mathematical foundations of theoretical statistics," *Phil.
Trans. R. Soc. A* **222** (1922), 309–368) and was made precise, in the kernel form used
here, by R. R. Bahadur ("Sufficiency and statistical decision functions," *Ann. Math.
Statist.* **25** (1954), 423–462). The factorization criterion is due to J. Neyman ("Sur un
teorema concernente le cosiddette statistiche sufficienti," *Giorn. Ist. Ital. Attuari* **6**
(1935), 320–334) with the measure-theoretic version of P. R. Halmos and L. J. Savage
("Application of the Radon–Nikodym theorem to the theory of sufficient statistics," *Ann.
Math. Statist.* **20** (1949), 225–241).
