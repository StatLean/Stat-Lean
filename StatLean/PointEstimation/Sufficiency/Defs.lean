# Sufficient statistics — core data model

A statistic `T : 𝓧 → S` is **sufficient** for a family `P : Θ → Measure 𝓧` when the
conditional distribution of the data given `T` admits a determination that does not
depend on `θ`. This file fixes the three equivalent carriers of that idea used in the
area, plus minimal sufficiency:

* `IsSufficient P T` — the per-event form: for every measurable `A ⊆ 𝓧` there is a
  θ-free measurable `κA : S → ℝ≥0∞` (a determination of `P_θ(A ∣ T = t)`) satisfying
  the defining property of conditional probability under every `P θ`;
* `HasSufficientKernel P T` — the regular-conditional form: a single θ-free Markov
  kernel `Q : S ⇝ 𝓧` disintegrating the graph law of `(T, id)` under every `P θ`,
  `(P θ).map (x ↦ (T x, x)) = ((P θ).map T) ⊗ₘ Q`;
* `IsFactorizedDensity p μ T g h` — the Fisher–Neyman factorization
  `p_θ = (g_θ ∘ T) · h` (`μ`-a.e., for every `θ`) of a dominated family's densities;
* `statLaw P T θ` — the law of the statistic, `(P θ).map T`;
* `IsMinimalSufficient P T` — sufficient, and a.e.-factoring through every other
  sufficient statistic.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The compProd (graph) form of `HasSufficientKernel` is deliberately stronger-looking
  than the reconstruction form `P θ = Q ∘ₖ' (statLaw)`: taking second marginals recovers
  reconstruction, while the graph form additionally pins the kernel to the fibers
  (`Q t {x | T x = t} = 1` a.e., proved in `Sufficiency.Basic`) — which Basu's theorem
  and the risk-equality theorem need. On standard Borel spaces the two are equivalent.
* `IsSufficient` phrases the defining property via `∫⁻` against `κA ∘ T` on
  `T`-cylinders; `κA ≤ 1` keeps determinations honest sub-probabilities.
* Minimal sufficiency quantifies over competitor statistics `U : 𝓧 → S'` with `S'` in
  a fixed universe; the factoring map is required measurable (as delivered by the
  likelihood-ratio construction) with the identity holding `P θ`-a.e. for every `θ`.

**Bibliographic comments.** Sufficiency is due to R. A. Fisher ("On the mathematical
foundations of theoretical statistics," *Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A* **222** (1922),
309–368); the factorization criterion to J. Neyman ("Sur un teorema concernente le
cosiddette statistiche sufficienti," *Giorn. Ist. Ital. Attuari* **6** (1935), 320–334);
the measure-theoretic theory — dominated families, the equivalent-mixture device, and
the factorization theorem in its modern form — to P. R. Halmos and L. J. Savage
("Application of the Radon–Nikodym theorem to the theory of sufficient statistics,"
*Ann. Math. Statist.* **20** (1949), 225–241). Minimal sufficiency is due to
E. L. Lehmann and H. Scheffé ("Completeness, similar regions, and unbiased estimation,"
*Sankhyā* **10** (1950), 305–340) and R. R. Bahadur ("Sufficiency and statistical
decision functions," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **25** (1954), 423–462).
