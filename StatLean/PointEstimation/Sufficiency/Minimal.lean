# Minimal sufficiency: the likelihood-ratio vector

A sufficient statistic is *minimal* when it reduces the data as far as any sufficient
statistic can — every sufficient statistic determines it. For a finite family with densities
`p₀, …, p_k` sharing a common support, the vector of likelihood ratios against a fixed
baseline member,
$$ T(x) \;=\; \Bigl(\frac{p_1(x)}{p_0(x)},\, \dots,\, \frac{p_k(x)}{p_0(x)}\Bigr), $$
is minimal sufficient. The engine behind this is a sharpening of the factorization criterion:
a statistic is sufficient exactly when all the density ratios of the family are functions of
it, so any sufficient statistic determines `T`, and `T` is itself sufficient.

* `likelihoodRatioVec` — the statistic displayed above;
* `isMinimalSufficient_likelihoodRatioVec` — it is minimal sufficient;
* `isSufficient_iff_ratio_factors` — sufficiency of a statistic `U` is equivalent to every
  density ratio factoring through `U` almost everywhere.

**Reference.** Classical construction of a minimal sufficient statistic for a finite family
with common support, and the likelihood-ratio criterion for sufficiency.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* Ratios are formed in `ℝ≥0∞`, where division is total (`a / 0 = ∞` for `a ≠ 0`, `0 / 0 = 0`),
  so `likelihoodRatioVec` is a genuine total definition with no junk-value caveats at the
  level of the definition; the common-support hypothesis enters as the positivity assumption
  `hpos` and makes the ratios meaningful almost everywhere.
* The "common support" of the classical statement is formalized as: every density is
  a.e. strictly positive with respect to the dominating measure. This is not a loss of
  generality — restrict `μ` to the common support — but it *is* a genuine restriction of the
  theorem relative to families whose supports vary with the parameter, which is exactly the
  restriction the classical statement makes.
* `hfin` (a.e. finiteness of the densities) is a Lean-side addition with no classical
  counterpart: `ℝ≥0∞`-valued densities may take the value `∞` on a `μ`-positive set only if
  the corresponding member is not σ-finite there, but ruling it out keeps the ratio algebra
  (`(a/b) * b = a`) usable without case analysis.
* `IsMinimalSufficient` quantifies competitor statistics over a fixed universe (see
  `Sufficiency.Defs`); the universe parameter is left to be inferred here.
* The subfamily lemma ("minimal for a subfamily plus sufficient for the whole family implies
  minimal for the whole family"), which is the classical route from finite families to
  general ones, is deliberately **not** stated here: it is not part of this campaign's
  ledger.

**Bibliographic comments.** Minimal sufficiency and the likelihood-ratio construction are due
to E. L. Lehmann and H. Scheffé ("Completeness, similar regions, and unbiased estimation,"
*Sankhyā* **10** (1950), 305–340), with the general existence theory developed by
E. B. Dynkin ("Necessary and sufficient statistics for a family of probability
distributions," *Uspekhi Mat. Nauk* **6** (1951), 68–90) and R. R. Bahadur ("Sufficiency and
statistical decision functions," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **25** (1954), 423–462; "Statistics
and subfields," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **26** (1955), 490–497). The underlying factorization
criterion is due to J. Neyman ("Sur un teorema concernente le cosiddette statistiche
sufficienti," *Giorn. Ist. Ital. Attuari* **6** (1935), 320–334) and P. R. Halmos and
L. J. Savage ("Application of the Radon–Nikodym theorem to the theory of sufficient
statistics," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **20** (1949), 225–241).
