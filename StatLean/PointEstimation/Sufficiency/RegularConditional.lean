# From per-event determinations to a θ-free regular conditional distribution

The definition of sufficiency only asks that *each* event `A` admit a determination of
`P_θ(A ∣ T = t)` free of `θ`. What decision theory actually uses is stronger: a single θ-free
Markov kernel `Q : S ⇝ 𝓧` which, for each fixed `t`, is a genuine probability measure and
which disintegrates the joint law of `(T(X), X)` under every member. On a standard Borel
sample space the two coincide.

* `hasSufficientKernel_of_isSufficient_dominated` — the **dominated** version: for a family
  dominated by a σ-finite measure on a standard Borel sample space, a sufficient statistic
  admits a θ-free reconstruction kernel. This is the version the rest of the area consumes.
* `hasSufficientKernel_of_isSufficient` — the general standard Borel version, without
  domination.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and J.P. Romano, *Testing Statistical Hypotheses*, 4th ed.,
Springer Nature Switzerland AG, 2022 (ISBN 978-3-030-70577-0), Chapter 2 (The Probability
Background), §2.6 (Sufficient Statistics), Theorem 2.6.1 (existence of a θ-free regular
conditional distribution given a sufficient statistic). (`TSH4 Thm 2.6.1`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* The dominated route avoids gluing per-event determinations altogether. Fix an equivalent
  countable mixture `ν` of members of the family and let `Q` be the conditional kernel of the
  graph law of `(T, id)` under `ν`, which exists on a standard Borel sample space
  (`MeasureTheory.Measure.condKernel`, requiring `[StandardBorelSpace 𝓧]` and `[Nonempty 𝓧]`
  on the *second* factor of the product; no condition on the value space `S` of the
  statistic). The Halmos–Savage criterion then shows that this single kernel disintegrates
  the graph law of *every* member: the density `dP_θ/dν` is a function of `T`, so tilting the
  disintegration of `ν` by it changes only the first marginal.
* `[Nonempty 𝓧]` is a technical requirement of Mathlib's disintegration API (a Markov kernel
  must have somewhere to put its mass) and is no restriction: the family consists of
  probability measures, so the sample space is nonempty whenever the parameter set is.
* The general (undominated) version genuinely needs the gluing argument: the per-`θ`
  disintegrations `Q_θ` agree only `statLaw P T θ`-almost everywhere, and for an uncountable
  parameter set no single `Q_θ` can serve (take `P θ = δ_θ` on `ℝ` with `T = id`: the kernel
  is pinned down at *every* point of `S`). The kernel is therefore built from the θ-free
  per-event determinations themselves, through the conditional distribution *functions*:
  `e := embeddingReal 𝓧` embeds the sample space into `ℝ`, the determinations `k q` of the
  half-lines `e ⁻¹' Iic q` (`q : ℚ`) form a θ-free rational CDF `f (·, t) q = (k q t).toReal`,
  `ProbabilityTheory.stieltjesOfMeasurableRat` repairs it off the bad set,
  `IsCondKernelCDF.toKernel` reads a Markov kernel `S ⇝ ℝ` off the repair, and
  `Kernel.borelMarkovFromReal` transports it back to `S ⇝ 𝓧`. Sufficiency enters exactly once,
  as the set-`lintegral` identity
  `∫⁻ b in B, k q b ∂(statLaw P T θ) = ρ_θ (B ×ˢ Iic q)` for the graph law `ρ_θ` of `(T, e)`,
  which is `IsRatCondKernelCDF.setIntegral` after the `ENNReal`-to-real passage. The
  almost-sure Stieltjes-point property is *imported* rather than reproved: it holds for
  Mathlib's `preCDF ρ_θ`, and `f` agrees with it `statLaw P T θ`-a.e. at every rational by
  uniqueness of set integrals, `ℚ` being countable. The `Unit`-indexed kernel API
  (`Kernel.const Unit ·`) is what carries the measure-level statement into the kernel-level
  disintegration lemmas, and `Measure.compProd` is definitionally the `Unit`-fibre of
  `Kernel.compProd`, which is how the conclusion comes back down.
* Both statements deliver the graph/compProd carrier `HasSufficientKernel` rather than a
  bare reconstruction identity, so that the fiber property of `Sufficiency.Basic` comes for
  free at the point of use.

**Bibliographic comments.** The existence of θ-free conditional distributions given a
sufficient statistic on Euclidean sample spaces is classical; the measure-theoretic treatment
for dominated families is due to P. R. Halmos and L. J. Savage ("Application of the
Radon–Nikodym theorem to the theory of sufficient statistics," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **20**
(1949), 225–241), and the decision-theoretic formulation, in which the reconstruction kernel
is the object of interest, to R. R. Bahadur ("Sufficiency and statistical decision
functions," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **25** (1954), 423–462; "Statistics and subfields," *Ann.
Math. Statist.* **26** (1955), 490–497).

/-- **General existence of a θ-free reconstruction kernel** on a standard Borel sample space,
without any domination assumption.

The per-event determinations are glued into a single kernel through the conditional
distribution *functions*, not through any disintegration of a single member: the sample space
is embedded into `ℝ` by `e := embeddingReal 𝓧`, the determinations `k q` of the rational
half-lines `e ⁻¹' Iic q` assemble into a θ-free rational CDF `f (·, t) q = (k q t).toReal`,
`stieltjesOfMeasurableRat` repairs it off the bad set, and `borelMarkovFromReal` transports
the resulting Markov kernel `S ⇝ ℝ` back to `S ⇝ 𝓧`. The one place where a *single* member
enters is the almost-sure Stieltjes-point property, and there it is harmless: it is imported
from Mathlib's own rational CDF `preCDF (ρ θ)` of the graph law of `(T, e)` under that member,
to which `f` is a.e. equal at every rational (both have set-`lintegral` `ρ θ (B ×ˢ Iic q)`,
and `ℚ` is countable). The kernel itself never depends on the member. -/
