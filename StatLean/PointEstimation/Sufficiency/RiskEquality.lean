# Sufficiency has no operational cost: risk equality through a sufficient statistic

If `T` is sufficient for the model `P`, then every estimator — randomized or not — can be
replaced by an estimator that looks only at `T`, with *exactly* the same risk function. The
replacement is the composition of the original decision rule with the θ-free reconstruction
kernel `Q`: report `t`, regenerate an observation `x ~ Q t`, and then act as before.

Writing `Q : S ⇝ 𝓧` for the reconstruction kernel and `κ : 𝓧 ⇝ D` for the (possibly
randomized) estimator, the diagram commutes:

```
              Q                 κ
    S  ───────────────▶  𝓧  ───────────▶  D
    ▲                    ▲                ▲
    │ statLaw P T θ      │ P θ            │ risk of κ under P θ
    └────────────────────┴────── κ ∘ₖ Q ──┘
```

the top row being the composed kernel `κ ∘ₖ Q : S ⇝ D` and the bottom row the identity
`Q ∘ₘ (statLaw P T θ) = P θ` of `Sufficiency.Basic`. Contents:

* `riskRand_comp_eq_riskRand` — the risk identity for a fixed reconstruction kernel;
* `exists_riskRand_eq_of_sufficient` — the existence form (for any estimator there is a
  `T`-based randomized estimator with the same risk function);
* `riskRand_deterministic` — a nonrandomized estimator, viewed as a Dirac kernel, has its
  original risk;
* `exists_riskRand_eq_risk_of_sufficient` — the corollary for nonrandomized estimators.

**Reference.** Classical sufficiency theory: the operational significance of sufficiency,
stated as risk-equality of a randomized estimator based on the sufficient statistic.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* **Composition order.** `Q : Kernel S 𝓧` and `κ : Kernel 𝓧 D` compose as `κ ∘ₖ Q :
  Kernel S D` (Mathlib's `Kernel.comp` reads right-to-left, like function composition:
  `(η ∘ₖ κ) a = (κ a).bind η`). The reverse order does not typecheck, which is a useful
  guard rail here.
* The proof is `Kernel.lintegral_comp` (unfold `κ ∘ₖ Q` into an iterated integral) followed
  by `Measure.lintegral_bind` and the reconstruction identity `statLaw_snd`; no
  conditional-expectation machinery is involved. Measurability of the loss in the decision
  argument is the only side condition, and it is needed only to move the integrals.
* Risks are `ℝ≥0∞`-valued (`Model.Defs`), so the identity is an honest equality even when
  both sides are `∞`: no integrability hypothesis is required anywhere.
* Nothing here uses the fiber property `Q t {x | T x = t} = 1`; the risk identity holds for
  any reconstruction kernel that disintegrates the graph law.

**Bibliographic comments.** The interpretation of sufficiency as "no information is lost",
made precise by regenerating the data from the statistic with an auxiliary random mechanism,
goes back to R. A. Fisher ("On the mathematical foundations of theoretical statistics,"
*Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A* **222** (1922), 309–368). Its decision-theoretic form — that the
class of risk functions attainable by all procedures coincides with the class attainable by
procedures depending on a sufficient statistic alone — is due to R. R. Bahadur ("Sufficiency
and statistical decision functions," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **25** (1954), 423–462), building
on D. Blackwell ("Conditional expectation and unbiased sequential estimation," *Ann. Math.
Statist.* **18** (1947), 105–110).
