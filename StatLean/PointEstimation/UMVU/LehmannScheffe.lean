# The Lehmann–Scheffé theorem

Rao–Blackwellization improves any estimator by averaging it over the fibers of a sufficient
statistic, but leaves open which function of the statistic to use. Completeness settles this:
a complete sufficient statistic admits *at most one* unbiased function, so all
Rao–Blackwellized estimators of the same estimand coincide, and the common value is
simultaneously optimal — not only for squared error, but for every convex loss.

* `unique_unbiased_function_of_complete` — at most one unbiased function of a complete
  statistic;
* `isUMVU_of_complete_sufficient` — the Rao–Blackwellization of any unbiased square-integrable
  estimator along a complete sufficient statistic is UMVU;
* `risk_le_of_complete_sufficient` — the same estimator minimizes the risk among all unbiased
  estimators, for every nonnegative convex loss;
* `isUMVU_of_fullRank_expFamily` — the specialization to a full-rank exponential family, whose
  natural statistic is complete and sufficient;
* `variance_condExp_le` and `condExp_comap_eq_rbEstimator` — the `condExp` form of the
  Rao–Blackwell step, which needs integrability where the kernel form needs measurability.

**Reference.** E.L. Lehmann and G. Casella, *Theory of Point Estimation*, 2nd ed.,
Springer-Verlag New York, 1998 (ISBN 0-387-98502-6), Chapter 2 (Unbiasedness), §2.1 (UMVU
Estimators), Lemma 1.10 (uniqueness of the unbiased function of a complete sufficient
statistic), Theorem 1.11 (Lehmann–Scheffé: minimum risk for every convex loss) and Corollary
1.12 (the full-rank exponential-family specialization). (`TPE2 §2.1 Lem 1.10, Thm 1.11, Cor
1.12`.)

**Proof formalization notes.**
* `unique_unbiased_function_of_complete` uses **only completeness**, not sufficiency: the
  difference of two unbiased functions of `T` integrates to zero under every law of `T`, and
  completeness concludes. The classical statement bundles sufficiency because it is stated for
  a complete sufficient statistic and because sufficiency is what makes unbiased functions of
  `T` *exist*; dropping it here strengthens the lemma and is recorded as a deliberate
  deviation.
* Optimality is proved by transport, not by a fresh variational argument: given a competitor
  `δ'`, its Rao–Blackwellization is an unbiased function of `T`, hence almost everywhere equal
  to the given one by the uniqueness lemma, and the Rao–Blackwell inequality applied to `δ'`
  finishes. The two theorems therefore have the same shape, with variance replaced by the
  `ℝ≥0∞`-valued convex risk.
* The risk statement fixes one unbiased integrable `δ` to build the estimator and quantifies
  over competitors `δ'` separately, rather than asserting a minimum over an unnamed class:
  this keeps the statement first-order and makes clear that the *same* estimator dominates
  every competitor.
* Integrability of the Rao–Blackwellized estimator under the laws of the statistic is derived
  from the corresponding property of `δ` through the reconstruction identity, not assumed
  (see the notes in `UMVU.RaoBlackwell`).
* Rao–Blackwellization appears here in two forms. The kernel form `rbEstimator Q δ`, which is
  what the Lehmann–Scheffé uniqueness step needs (its completeness test function must be
  globally measurable), and the `condExp` form, which needs only integrability. They agree
  (`condExp_comap_eq_rbEstimator`), and the variance half of Rao–Blackwell holds for the
  `condExp` form with no measurability input at all (`variance_condExp_le`, the law of total
  variance). The `IsUMVU` minimality clause quantifies over competitors carrying only
  `MemEstL2`, i.e. a *per-parameter* a.e. measurable version, which is precisely the class the
  globally-measurable completeness test cannot reach; see the note inside
  `isUMVU_of_complete_sufficient`.
* `isUMVU_of_fullRank_expFamily` combines the completeness of the natural statistic of a
  full-rank exponential family with the two theorems above. It is phrased as the *existence*
  of a measurable function of the natural statistic which is UMVU, since the function itself
  is only determined almost everywhere. The full-rank condition is imposed on a parameter set
  that the family is required to cover. Its signature deviates from the printed statement —
  the natural statistic is `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin s)`-valued and the reference measure is
  σ-finite; both deviations are documented at the theorem.

("Completeness, similar regions, and unbiased estimation," *Sankhyā* **10** (1950), 305–340;

estimation," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **18** (1947), 105–110). That the existence of a complete
sufficient statistic is, under mild conditions, also *necessary* for every estimable function
to admit a uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator is due to R. R. Bahadur ("On unbiased
estimates of uniformly minimum variance," *Sankhyā* **18** (1957), 211–224). The completeness
of the natural statistic of a full-rank exponential family is established in Lehmann and

### The `condExp` Rao–Blackwell layer

The kernel form of Rao–Blackwellization, `rbEstimator Q δ = fun s => ∫ δ dQ_s`, needs a
genuine measurable `δ` in order to be a measurable function of `s` at all. The conditional
expectation `(P θ)[δ | σ(T)]` needs only *integrability* under the single measure `P θ`. The
two agree (`condExp_comap_eq_rbEstimator`), and the variance-reduction half of Rao–Blackwell
holds for the conditional expectation with no measurability input whatsoever
(`variance_condExp_le`, the law of total variance).

/-- Lehmann–Scheffé minimality for an **arbitrary** square-integrable unbiased competitor.

The classical argument Rao–Blackwellizes the competitor `δ'` through `T` and compares by
`variance_rbEstimator_le`, then identifies the two Rao–Blackwellizations via
`unique_unbiased_function_of_complete`: both `rbEstimator Q δ` and `rbEstimator Q δ'` are
unbiased functions of the complete statistic `T`, hence a.e. equal, so the variance of the
former equals that of `rbEstimator Q δ' ∘ T`, which does not exceed `var δ'`.

**Added hypothesis (private lemma, pre-authorized).** `hδ'm : Measurable δ'`. Both the kernel
average `t ↦ ∫ δ' dQ_t = rbEstimator Q δ'` and the completeness test function require `δ'` to
carry a genuine (global) measurable representative. The `IsUMVU` minimality quantifies over
competitors holding only `MemEstL2 P δ'`, i.e. a *per-parameter* `AEStronglyMeasurable`
version; with no dominating measure these do not glue to a single measurable function (false
in general — Dirac families are a counterexample). This private lemma is therefore stated for
measurable competitors; the consumer `isUMVU_of_complete_sufficient` cannot discharge that
hypothesis for an arbitrary `MemEstL2` competitor (see the note there). -/

    -- Why (†) is not reachable here. Choose a measurable `P θ`-version `d` of `δ'`
    -- (`(hδ'2 θ).aestronglyMeasurable.mk`). By `condExp_comap_eq_rbEstimator`,
    -- `(P θ)[δ' | m] = (P θ)[d | m] =ᵐ[P θ] fun x => rbEstimator Q d (T x)`, so (†) is
    -- exactly `rbEstimator Q d =ᵐ[statLaw P T θ] rbEstimator Q δ`. Both sides are genuinely
    -- measurable functions on `S`, so `unique_unbiased_function_of_complete` applies — but it
    -- consumes unbiasedness of `rbEstimator Q d` at *every* parameter, i.e. `∫ d dP θ' = g θ'`
    -- for all `θ'`, while `d` agrees with `δ'` only `P θ`-a.e.; off that class `d` is
    -- arbitrary, and the model carries no dominating measure that would let the per-parameter
    -- versions of `δ'` be glued into one representative unbiased throughout (Dirac-type
    -- families show the gluing fails in general).
    --
    -- Equivalently: `rbEstimator Q δ'` (junk-valued where `δ'` is not `Q s`-integrable) *is*
    -- unbiased at every `θ'` and is `AEStronglyMeasurable` for every `statLaw P T θ'`, so what
    -- remains is completeness of `T` tested against functions that are only *per-parameter*
    -- a.e. measurable. `IsCompleteStat`, by definition, tests globally measurable functions,
    -- and the strengthening does not follow from it. The same obstruction is reached from the
    -- covariance criterion (`isUMVU_iff_uncorrelated_unbiasedZero`): one needs
    -- `E_θ[U | T] = 0` for competitors `U` of zero mean that are only a.e. measurable.
    --
    -- Consequently this is *not* a missing-lemma gap but a gap between the frozen `IsUMVU`
    -- competitor class (`MemEstL2`, per-parameter a.e. measurable) and the frozen
    -- `IsCompleteStat` test class (globally measurable). For competitors that do carry a
    -- global measurable representative the theorem is proved, without debt, by the private
    -- lemma `variance_rbEstimator_le_of_complete` above. Left as sanctioned debt.

/-- **Full-rank exponential families.** For a family that is a canonical exponential family of
full rank, every estimable function admits a uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator,
and it is a function of the natural statistic.

**Deviation from the printed statement (authorized signature amendment).** The natural
statistic is specialized from an abstract real inner-product space `V` to
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin s)`, and one instance on the reference measure is added,
`[SigmaFinite E.base]`. Both are forced:

* the only completeness theorem for the natural statistic,
  `isCompleteStat_of_interior_nonempty`, is `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin s)`-valued, because the
  Laplace/MGF-uniqueness brick it consumes (`ae_eq_zero_of_integral_exp_inner_eq_zero`) is a
  finite-dimensional fact; there is no completeness statement for an abstract `V`;
* `[SigmaFinite E.base]` is what turns the Fisher–Neyman factorization of the densities into
  sufficiency (`isSufficient_of_isFactorizedDensity`) and then into the θ-free reconstruction
  kernel (`hasSufficientKernel_of_isSufficient_dominated`).

Nothing else is added. In particular neither `E.base ≠ 0` nor membership of the parameters in
the natural parameter set is assumed: both are *derived* from
`[∀ θ, IsProbabilityMeasure (P θ)]`, since off the natural parameter set — and for a zero
reference measure — every member of the family is the zero measure. -/
