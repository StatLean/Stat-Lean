# Rao–Blackwellization: averaging an estimator over the fibers of a sufficient statistic

Given a sufficient statistic `T` with θ-free reconstruction kernel `Q : S ⇝ 𝓧`, any estimator
`δ` can be replaced by its average over the reconstruction fibers,
$$ \eta(t) \;=\; \int \delta(x)\, dQ_t(x), $$
an estimator that reads the data only through `T`. Averaging preserves unbiasedness and can
only decrease the risk, for every loss that is convex in the decision:

* `rbEstimator` — the fiberwise average displayed above;
* `isUnbiased_rbEstimator` — unbiasedness is preserved;
* `risk_rbEstimator_le` — the risk decreases, for every nonnegative convex loss;
* `variance_rbEstimator_le` — the squared-error case.

**Reference.** Classical conditioning (Rao–Blackwell) theorem for sufficient statistics.

**Proof formalization notes.**
* **Plain Jensen, not conditional Jensen.** Because the reconstruction kernel is available as
  data, the inequality is proved *pointwise in `t`* by ordinary Jensen's inequality
  (`ConvexOn.map_integral_le`) applied to the probability measure `Q t`, and only then
  integrated against the law of the statistic. No conditional-expectation machinery, no
  conditional Jensen, and no filtration bookkeeping is involved. This is the main reason the
  area's sufficiency carrier is a kernel rather than a σ-field.
* **Fiber integrability is derived, not assumed.** The hypotheses ask only for integrability
  under the members `P θ`. That `δ` (respectively `ρ θ ∘ δ`, respectively `δ²`) is integrable
  against `Q t` for almost every `t` follows from the reconstruction identity
  `Q ∘ₘ (statLaw P T θ) = P θ` together with the fact that an iterated `∫⁻` is finite only if
  its inner integral is finite almost everywhere. Assuming the fiber conditions instead would
  be hypothesis laundering: they are forced by the setup, not free inputs.
* `rbEstimator` is defined by a Bochner integral, hence returns the junk value `0` on fibers
  where `δ` fails to be integrable. Under the hypotheses of the theorems below this happens
  only on a null set of values of the statistic, so the junk never propagates.
* Risks are `ℝ≥0∞`-valued and losses enter through `ENNReal.ofReal`, matching `Model.Defs`.
  The convex loss is required nonnegative, so that `ENNReal.ofReal` loses no information, and
  continuous, which for a convex function on all of `ℝ` is automatic; the hypothesis is kept
  explicit only to avoid importing the convex-continuity machinery, and may be dropped once
  it is available.
* The finite-risk hypothesis `hρi` is a genuine restriction only in appearance: if the risk of
  `δ` is infinite the inequality is trivially true, so the statement could be strengthened by
  case analysis. It is kept because the Jensen step consumes exactly this integrability.

**Bibliographic comments.** The theorem is due to C. R. Rao ("Information and the accuracy
attainable in the estimation of statistical parameters," *Bull. Calcutta Math. Soc.* **37**
(1945), 81–91) and D. Blackwell ("Conditional expectation and unbiased sequential
estimation," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **18** (1947), 105–110); its extension from squared error
to arbitrary convex losses, via Jensen's inequality, is standard and appears in E. L. Lehmann
and H. Scheffé ("Completeness, similar regions, and unbiased estimation," *Sankhyā* **10**
(1950), 305–340). The formulation in terms of a reconstruction kernel rather than a
conditional expectation follows R. R. Bahadur ("Sufficiency and statistical decision
functions," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **25** (1954), 423–462).
