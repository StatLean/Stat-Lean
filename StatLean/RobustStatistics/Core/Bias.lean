# Contamination bias — worst-case perturbation of a functional

The asymptotic bias of a functional `T` at a contaminated distribution is
`T((1-ε)P + εQ) - T(P)`, and the *maximum bias* is its supremum over all contaminating
`Q` (`MMY §3.3`). Following the statement-first design, the primitive here is the bounded
form: `ContaminationBiasLE T P ε b` says every contamination of size `ε` moves `T` by at
most `b`. Unbounded maximum bias (the mean, `LocationScale/Mean.lean`) is the negation
`∀ b, ¬ ContaminationBiasLE …`; the extended-real supremum can be layered on later without
touching consumers.

* `ContaminationBiasLE T P ε b` — every `ε`-contamination moves `T` by at most `b`.
* monotonicity in the bound, the `ε = 0` degenerate case, and the point-mass specialization.
