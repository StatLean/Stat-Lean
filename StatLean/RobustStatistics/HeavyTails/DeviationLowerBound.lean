# The sub-Gaussian deviation rate is optimal — no estimator beats `σ√(log(1/(2δ))/n)`

The minimax counterpart of the estimators in this directory (`LM Theorem 1`, after
Devroye–Lerasle–Lugosi–Oliveira (2016)): for *any* mean estimator there is a
finite-variance distribution on which its deviation at confidence `δ` is at least
`σ√(log(1/(2δ))/n)`. The witness family is a two-point pair `P₊, P₋` placing mass `p` at
`±c` and `1 − p` at `0` — built here from Round-1's `contaminate` applied to Dirac
masses — coupled so that the two samples agree with probability `(1−p)ⁿ = 2δ`; on that
event no estimator can be simultaneously close to both means `±pc`.

**Constant.** `LM` print the threshold as `σ√(log(1/δ)/n)`; the threshold proved here is
`σ√(log(1/(2δ))/n)`. The `log 2` is the price of the factor `2` in the two-point
argument and cannot be removed along this route on the frozen window `δ < 1/2` — see the
`CONSTANT REPAIR` note on `mean_estimator_deviation_lower`.

* `twoPointPM` and its mean/variance.
* `twoPointCoupling` — the joint law on `ℝ × ℝ`, its marginals, and the diagonal mass.
* `agree_pow` — the samples agree with probability `(1 − p)ⁿ`.
* `mean_estimator_deviation_lower` — `LM Theorem 1`.

**Honest reading of the statement.** LM phrase the conclusion "there exists a
distribution with mean `μ` and variance `σ²`"; the two exhibited distributions have
means `±pc`, so the centering in the deviation event is the exhibited distribution's
*own* mean (the pair cannot share it), and the free centering `μ` of LM's phrasing is
recovered by translating the whole construction. We state the translation-fixed form.

/-- **No mean estimator beats the sub-Gaussian rate** (`LM Theorem 1`): for every
sample size `n > 5`, confidence `δ ∈ (2e^{−n/4}, 1/2)`, target variance `σ² > 0`, and
*any* measurable estimator `μ̂ : (Fin n → ℝ) → ℝ`, there is a probability distribution
`P` with variance `σ²` whose own mean `μ_P` satisfies

  `Pⁿ( |μ̂ − μ_P| > σ√(log(1/(2δ))/n) ) ≥ δ`.

The witness is one of the coupled two-point pair with `1 − p = (2δ)^{1/n}` and
`c = σ/√(p(1−p))`; the agreement event has probability exactly `2δ` and forces one of
the two means — which are `2pc` apart — to be missed, so one of the two error
probabilities is `≥ δ`.

**CONSTANT REPAIR (deviation from `LM Theorem 1` as printed).** LM state the threshold
as `σ√(log(1/δ)/n)`; the threshold proved here is `σ√(log(1/(2δ))/n)`, i.e. their
`log(1/δ)` is replaced by `log(1/(2δ)) = log(1/δ) − log 2`. The shape (and the
asymptotics as `δ → 0`) is unchanged; the `log 2` is the honest price of the factor `2`
in the two-point argument, and it cannot be avoided along this route:

* the argument only ever gives `max(err₊, err₋) ≥ ½·P{X₁ⁿ = Y₁ⁿ} = ½(1−p)ⁿ`, so a
  conclusion `≥ δ` *requires* `(1−p)ⁿ ≥ 2δ`, i.e. `n·log(1/(1−p)) ≤ log(1/δ) − log 2`;
* the separation of the two means is `pc = σ√(p/(1−p))`, so a threshold
  `C·σ√(log(1/δ)/n)` *requires* `p/(1−p) > C²·log(1/δ)/n`.

Writing `q = p/(1−p)` and `L = log(1/δ)`, the first demand is exactly
`1 − p ≥ (2δ)^{1/n}`, i.e. `q ≤ e^{(L−log 2)/n} − 1`, while the second is
`q > C²L/n`. As `δ ↑ 1/2` the available separation `e^{(L−log 2)/n} − 1` tends to `0`
whereas the demanded one stays `≥ C²(log 2)/n > 0`, so **no constant `C > 0` works
uniformly on the frozen window `δ < 1/2`**: the `log 2` has to move inside the
logarithm, which is what the statement below does. (Restricting to `δ ≤ 1/4` would
instead permit `C = 1/√2`, since then `L ≥ 2 log 2` and `C²L ≤ L − log 2`.) The choice
`1 − p = (2δ)^{1/n}` used here is the extremal one — it makes the agreement probability
exactly `2δ` — and `e^x − 1 > x` then gives the strict separation.

This is an obstruction *for the two-point route*, not a refutation of `LM Theorem 1` as
printed: no estimator beating the `C = 1` threshold is exhibited here, so the original
statement is left open rather than marked false.

Only `0 < δ` is used from `hδlo` and only `0 < n` from `hn`; both frozen hypotheses are
kept (the sharper window is what `LM` need for their own choice `p = log(2/δ)/(2n)`,
which is not the optimal one). -/
