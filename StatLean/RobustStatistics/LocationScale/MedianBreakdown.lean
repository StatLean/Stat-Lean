# Breakdown of the sample median — the maximal-resistance theorem

The flagship finite-sample robustness contrast (`MMY §3.2.5`): for `n = 2k+1`
observations, the sample median resists `k` arbitrary replacements but breaks under
`k+1`, so its breakdown count is exactly `m* = k = ⌊(n-1)/2⌋` — the maximum possible for
any location-equivariant estimator (`MMY` eq. (3.26), `Core/BreakdownPoint.lean`) — while
the sample mean has `m* = 0` (`LocationScale/Mean.lean`).

* `sampleMedian_resists` — with at most `k` replacements, the median stays within the
  range of the original data (via the replacement-perturbation bound
  `orderStat_le_of_hammingDist`).
* `sampleMedian_breaksUnder` — `k+1` replacements placed at a common large value drag
  the median beyond any bound.
* `sampleMedian_breakdownCount` — `m*(Med, x) = k`, hence `ε*_n = k/(2k+1) → 1/2`.
* `sampleMedian_breakdownCount_eq_max` — the median attains the location-equivariant
  maximum `⌊(n-1)/2⌋`.

/-- The quantitative resistance bound, stated before `sampleMedian_resists` so that the
latter can use it (the public restatement is `sampleMedian_mem_Icc_of_hammingDist`).

With `n = 2k+1` the median is `y₍ₖ₎`; the replacement-perturbation bound
`orderStat_le_of_hammingDist` applies twice, at `0 + k ≤ k` and at `k + k ≤ 2k`, giving
`x₍₀₎ ≤ y₍ₖ₎ ≤ x₍₂ₖ₎`. -/
