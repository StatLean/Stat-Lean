# Finite-sample breakdown of dispersion estimators — the SD implodes never but explodes
# at once; the MAD resists half

For a dispersion estimator the parameter space is `Θ = (0, ∞)`, so the finite-sample
breakdown notion (`MMY §3.2.5`, Definition (3.25)) must guard *both* boundary pieces:
a corrupted sample breaks the estimator if it can be driven to `∞` (**explosion**) *or*
to `0` (**implosion**). This file gives the dispersion analogue of Round-1's
`Resists`/`breakdownCount` lattice and the two classical verdicts (`MMY §3.2.2`,
Problem 3.3, finite-sample form):

* the sample standard deviation breaks under a **single** replacement (`ε* = 0`);
* the sample MAD (odd `n = 2k+1`, distinct data) resists `k − 1` replacements and
  implodes under `k` — duplicating `k` values at one data point collapses a majority of
  the absolute deviations to `0` — so its breakdown count is exactly `k − 1` and its
  breakdown point tends to `1/2`.

* `DispersionResists`, `DispersionBreaksUnder`, `dispersionBreakdownCount` — the
  implosion-aware lattice (mirroring `Core/BreakdownPoint`).
* `sampleSD` and `sampleSD_breaksUnder_one` / `sampleSD_dispersionBreakdownCount`.
* `sampleMAD_implodes_under` / `sampleMAD_dispersionResists` /
  `sampleMAD_dispersionBreakdownCount`.
