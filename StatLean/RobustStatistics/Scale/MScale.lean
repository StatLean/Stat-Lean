# Scale M-functionals — the log-scale reduction and the breakdown point `min(δ, 1−δ)`

A scale M-estimate solves `(1/n) ∑ ρ(xᵢ/σ̂) = δ` (`MMY §2.5`, eq. (2.49)); its population
version solves `∫ ρ(x/σ) dP = δ`. Robustness of a scale estimator means staying away
from *both* boundary pieces of `Θ = (0, ∞)`: contamination can cause **explosion**
(`σ → ∞`, outliers) or **implosion** (`σ → 0`, inliers). The organizing device — `MMY
§3.2.2` — is that a scale M-estimator is a *location* M-estimator "in the log scale":
with `y = log|x|`, `μ = log σ`, `ψ(t) = ρ(eᵗ) − δ`, the scale equation becomes the
location equation, and the Round-1 location breakdown pair (`MMY (3.21)`/(3.22)) with
`k₁ = δ`, `k₂ = 1 − δ` yields the scale breakdown point

  `ε* = min(δ, 1 − δ)`   (`MMY (3.23)`),

with `δ` the explosion BP and `1 − δ` the implosion BP.

* `IsMScaleRoot` — the population scale M-equation (`MMY (2.49)`, population form).
* `logAbs`, `scaleScorePsi` — the log-scale transport data.
* `isMScaleRoot_iff_logScale` — the reduction (`MMY §3.2.2`, the display).
* `mScaleRoot_bounded_of_contamination` — no explosion, no implosion below
  `min(δ, 1−δ)` (`MMY (3.23)`, stability direction).
* `mScaleRoot_explodes` / `mScaleRoot_implodes` — sharpness beyond the BP.

Continuity is *not* cosmetic: `exp t > 0` for every `t`, so the `−∞` limit is the limit
of `ρ` at `0⁺`, which equals `ρ(0) = 0` only under continuity at `0` — for the (monotone,
`ρ(0)=0`) indicator loss `ρ = 1_{(0,∞)}` the transported score is *constantly* `1 − δ`
and the claimed `−δ` limit fails. This is why the MAD's indicator loss is excluded from

/-! ### Shared envelopes for bounded even ρ-functions

A ρ-function of `MMY §2.5` takes values in `[0,1]`: on `[0,∞)` it increases from
`ρ(0) = 0` to `ρ(∞) = 1`, and evenness carries the bound to the whole line. This supplies
the domination envelope for every integral below. -/

Why `s > 0` and not `s = 0`: with the whole contaminating mass exactly at `0` the
contaminated equation reads `(1−ε) ∫ρ(x/σ) dP = δ`, whose left side is `< δ` for every
