# Statistical learning — the risk/ERM/PAC data model

The general learning setting of SSBD Ch. 2–4: an example domain `Z`, an
abstract hypothesis type `H`, a loss family `ℓ : H → Z → ℝ`, true risk
`L_D(h) = E_{z∼D} ℓ(h,z)` (SSBD Eq. (3.3)), empirical risk
`L_S(h) = n⁻¹ ∑ᵢ ℓ(h, zᵢ)` (SSBD Eq. (3.4)), the ERM/approximate-ERM
*predicates* (SSBD §2.3 — deliberately not an `argmin` construction),
`ε`-representative samples in sup-free `∀`-form (SSBD Definition 4.1), and the
sample-complexity-witnessed learnability predicates: uniform convergence (SSBD
Definition 4.3), agnostic PAC (SSBD Definition 3.4), and realizable PAC for
binary classification (SSBD Definitions 2.1 and 3.1).

**Reference.** Shalev-Shwartz & Ben-David, *Understanding Machine Learning*
(Cambridge, 2014), Ch. 2–4. Exact transcriptions:
`notes/statistical_learning/book_statements/ch2-5.md`.

**Formalization notes.**
* A sample is a *sequence* `Fin n → Z` (SSBD footnote 1, p. 14: order and
  repeats matter); its law is the `n`-fold product `Measure.pi` (`D^m`).
* Probability statements are phrased as
  `ENNReal.ofReal (1 − δ) ≤ sampleLaw D n {s | …}` on raw (outer-measure)
  events; measurability enters only in proofs, as LEAN-ONLY hypotheses
  (SSBD Remark 3.1 measurability caveat).
* Best-in-class risk is `sInf (risk D ℓ '' 𝓗)` (image form — avoids the
  real-`⨅` junk floor at `0`); junk value `0` when `𝓗 = ∅` or the image is
  unbounded below. Theorems carry nonemptiness/nonnegativity hypotheses.
* This file is a laptop-only Defs surface: definitions and instances only,
  0-sorry; all lemma content lives in the sibling files.

**Bibliographic comments.** The PAC model is due to L. G. Valiant, "A theory
of the learnable," *Comm. ACM* 27 (1984), 1134–1142; the agnostic extension to
D. Haussler, "Decision theoretic generalizations of the PAC model," *Inf.
Comput.* 100 (1992), 78–150. Uniform convergence as the route to learnability
goes back to Vapnik–Chervonenkis (1971).

`h` on the sample `s`. Edge behavior: `n = 0` gives junk `0` (`(0:ℝ)⁻¹ = 0`). -/

lies in the class and its empirical risk is minimal over the class. Existence,
selection, and measurability of a minimizer are deliberately *not* built in —
an ERM selector enters downstream theorems as data. -/

(SSBD Definition 4.3): for every distribution and every `n ≥ mUC ε δ`, an
i.i.d. sample is `ε`-representative with probability at least `1 − δ`. The
event is a raw (outer-measure) set — measurability is a proof-side concern. -/
