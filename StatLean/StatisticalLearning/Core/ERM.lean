# ERM on a representative sample, and uniform convergence ⇒ agnostic PAC

The deterministic heart of learning via uniform convergence: on an
`ε/2`-representative sample every (approximate) empirical risk minimizer is
`ε`-optimal in true risk (SSBD Lemma 4.2), and hence a class with the uniform
convergence property is agnostically PAC learnable by any ERM selector with
`m(ε,δ) ≤ m^{UC}(ε/2, δ)` (SSBD Corollary 4.4).

**Reference.** SSBD §4.1 (Lemma 4.2, Corollary 4.4). Transcriptions:
`notes/statistical_learning/book_statements/ch2-5.md`.

**Formalization notes.** Lemma 4.2's three-inequality chain
`L_D(h_S) ≤ L_S(h_S) + ε/2 ≤ L_S(g) + ε/2 ≤ L_D(g) + ε` is verbatim; the
`sInf`-image form of the best-in-class risk requires a `BddBelow` side
condition, discharged from loss nonnegativity in the corollaries. The ERM
*selector* `A` is data (the book's `ERM_𝓗` paradigm — a choice function),
per the repo's hypothesis discipline for minimizers.
