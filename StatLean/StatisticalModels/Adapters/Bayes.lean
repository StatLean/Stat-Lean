# Adapter: the model calculus and the Bayesian area

Bridges to `StatLean.Bayesian` (imported, never redefined):

* `experimentOf` — a measurably-parameterized probability model plus a prior is a
  `BayesExperiment` (Robert Def 1.2.1), with `predictive` agreeing with the model-side
  observation of the prior;
* `iid_coe` — the area's `iid` agrees with the Bayesian area's `iidKernel` on kernel models
  (tying down that idiom; no fourth iid encoding is introduced);
* `dataMarginal_eq_bind_observe` — the hierarchical prior predictive
  (`HierBayesExperiment.dataMarginal`) is the hyperprior bound through the model-calculus
  observation of the prior kernel by the likelihood: **latent-variable marginalization on the
  Bayes side is the calculus' `observe` composed with the hyperprior** — one bridge, no
  duplication.

**Reference.** C. P. Robert, *The Bayesian Choice*, 2nd ed., Springer, 2007, §1.2
Definition 1.2.1 and §1.4 (joint, marginal, posterior); A. Gelman et al., *Bayesian Data
Analysis*, 3rd ed., 2014, §5.2 (hierarchical models).

**Proof formalization notes.** `experimentOf` is definitional assembly (`toKernel` +
`isMarkovKernel_toKernel_iff`); `iid_coe` is `funext` + `iidKernel_apply` (both sides are
`Measure.pi` of the kernel member — `rfl`-level), and likewise `iidSeq_coe` via
`iidSeqKernel_apply` (the Bayesian sequence kernel is itself `Measure.infinitePi`-based, so
the agreement is definitional, not a projective-limit argument).

**Bibliographic comments.** The kernel formulation of the Bayesian model is the
regular-conditional-distribution tradition of Doob; see the bibliographic notes of
`Bayesian.Experiment.Defs`.
