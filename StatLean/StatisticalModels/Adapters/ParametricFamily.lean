# Adapter: dominated families ↔ the density carrier `ParametricFamily`

Interconversion between this area's measure-level dominated models
(`IsDominatedFamily P μ`, `Model.Defs`) and the library's density-level carrier
`AsymptoticStatistics.ParametricFamily` + `IsPDFOf` (via
`AsymptoticStatistics.ParametricFamily.toMeasure`, defined in
`StatLean.PointEstimation.Model.Defs`):

* density → measure: `toMeasure` lands in probability measures (`isProbabilityMeasure_toMeasure`)
  and is dominated (`isDominatedFamily_toMeasure`);
* measure → density: `ofDominated` recovers a `ParametricFamily` from a dominated family via
  Radon–Nikodym derivatives, with the round trip `toMeasure_ofDominated`.

The iid agreement `iid (M.toMeasure μ) n = AsymptoticStatistics.productMeasure M μ · n` holds
definitionally (both sides are `Measure.pi` of `toMeasure`) but is deliberately **not** stated
here: naming `productMeasure` would import the heavy LAN assembly module
(`LocalAsymptoticNormality.AsymptoticRepresentation`); the one-line agreement lemma is a
documented laptop follow-up in that file, not an import here.

**Reference.** Dominated families and their density representations: P. R. Halmos and
L. J. Savage, "Application of the Radon–Nikodym theorem to the theory of sufficient
statistics," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **20** (1949), 225–241; TPE2 §1.4 (verify §).

**Proof formalization notes.** `isProbabilityMeasure_toMeasure` hoists the inline computation
already performed at `LocalAsymptoticNormality/AsymptoticRepresentation.lean` (~line 100)
(`withDensity`-mass via `ENNReal.ofReal` of the normalization integral) into a named reusable
lemma — hoisted, not duplicated: that file can later rewrite through this one. `ofDominated`
takes real-valued densities `(∂P θ/∂μ).toReal`; the round trip needs σ-finiteness of the
members (LEAN-ONLY, satisfied by probability models) so that
`withDensity_rnDeriv_eq`-style reconstruction applies.

**Bibliographic comments.** Radon–Nikodym reconstruction of dominated families is the
Halmos–Savage device; the `toReal`/`ofReal` round trip is Lean-side bookkeeping with no book
counterpart.
