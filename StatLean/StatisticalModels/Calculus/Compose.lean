# Algebra of the model calculus — composition laws and probability preservation

The functoriality laws making `Calculus.Defs` a calculus rather than a list of definitions:
composing observations is observation by the composed kernel; deterministic observation is
pushforward; pushforward is functorial; observation commutes with latent marginalization; and
every operation preserves "the model is a family of *probability* measures" (the instances).

Main statements:

* `observe_observe` — $\kappa\text{-then-}\eta$ observation is observation by `η ∘ₖ κ`
  (composition of coarsening mechanisms, Heitjan–Rubin §2);
* `observe_deterministic` — observation through `Kernel.deterministic T hT` is `pushforward T`
  (deterministic coarsening = transformation);
* `pushforward_pushforward`, `pushforward_id`, `observe_id` — functoriality;
* `observe_mix`, `observe_eq_mix_const`, `mix_deterministic` — interaction of observation and
  latent marginalization;
* `observe_reparam`, `pushforward_reparam` — the calculus commutes with reparameterization
  `P ∘ g` (definitionally);
* `IsProbabilityMeasure` instances for `observe`, `mix`, `condProd`, `iid`, `indepProd`,
  `iidSeq`, and the theorem `isProbabilityMeasure_pushforward`.

**Reference.** Composition of observation channels: L. Le Cam, "Sufficiency and approximate
sufficiency," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **35** (1964), 1419–1455 (transitions compose); coarsening
mechanisms: D. F. Heitjan and D. B. Rubin, "Ignorability and coarse data," *Ann. Statist.*
**19** (1991), §2.

**Proof formalization notes.** Every law is `funext θ` plus one Mathlib brick:
`Measure.comp_assoc` (hypothesis-free) for `observe_observe`, `Kernel.deterministic_comp_eq_map`
for `observe_deterministic`, `Measure.map_map` for `pushforward_pushforward`. The reparam laws
are definitional (`rfl`). Instances follow the `mixPrior` pattern of
`StatLean.Bayesian.Hierarchical.Defs` (`unfold` + `infer_instance` against Mathlib's instances
for `∘ₘ`, `⊗ₘ`, `Measure.pi`, `Measure.infinitePi`).

**Bibliographic comments.** That statistical "experiments" with transition channels form a
category is the starting point of Le Cam's theory of experiments (Le Cam, *Asymptotic Methods
in Statistical Decision Theory*, Springer, 1986, Ch. 1–3); the model calculus here is the
measure-level shadow of that categorical structure.
