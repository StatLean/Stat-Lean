# The model calculus — operations on families of probability measures

The compositional operations that build structured statistical models from simpler ones, all
defined on the bare carrier `P : Θ → Measure 𝓧` over an arbitrary parameter type `Θ`:

* `pushforward P T` — the model for the statistic `T(X)`: `θ ↦ (P θ).map T`;
* `observe P κ` — **observation/coarsening** through a θ-free Markov kernel `κ : 𝓧 ⇝ 𝓨`
  (`θ ↦ κ ∘ₘ P θ`): the ignorable-mechanism case covering censoring readouts, missingness
  masks, measurement error and randomized coarsening;
* `mix P K` — **latent-variable marginalization** through a θ-dependent kernel family
  (`θ ↦ K θ ∘ₘ P θ`): mixed effects, frailty, latent classes, mixtures;
* `condProd P K` — the **regression joint law** on `𝓧 × 𝓨`: covariate marginal `P θ` composed
  with response kernel `K θ` (`θ ↦ P θ ⊗ₘ K θ`);
* `iid P n`, `indepProd P`, `iidSeq P` — replication: `n`-fold iid product (`Measure.pi`),
  independent-not-identical product, and the infinite iid sequence (`Measure.infinitePi`).

Reparameterization and restriction are deliberately **not** new definitions — they are function
composition `P ∘ g` and `P ∘ Subtype.val`; their content is the identifiability transfer lemmas
in `Identifiability.Transfer`.

**Reference.** Model construction by transformation, coarsening, mixing, conditioning and
replication: A. C. Davison, *Statistical Models*, Cambridge Series in Statistical and
Probabilistic Mathematics, Cambridge University Press, 2003 (ISBN 0-521-77339-3), Chapter 5
(Models), §5.1–5.2 (verify §). Observation/coarsening as a Markov kernel on the full data:

no. 4, 2244–2253, §2.

**Proof formalization notes.** Laptop-only data model — definitions only; all lemmas (algebra
of the operations, probability-preservation instances, marginals) live in `Calculus.Compose`
and `Calculus.Marginal`. The θ-free `observe` is the primary observation operation (its laws
are hypothesis-free and it is the case in which identifiability and risk theorems live);
`observe P κ = mix P (fun _ => κ)` definitionally, so nothing is lost. Everything is a thin
wrapper over Mathlib: `Measure.map`, `Measure.bind` (`∘ₘ`), `Measure.compProd` (`⊗ₘ`),
`Measure.pi`, `Measure.infinitePi` — no bespoke measure constructions, hence full
interoperability with the rest of the library and with Mathlib's kernel algebra
(`Model.KernelAgreement`).

**Bibliographic comments.** Randomization/observation channels acting on statistical models go
back to L. Le Cam, "Sufficiency and approximate sufficiency," *Ann. Math. Statist.* **35**
(1964), 1419–1455 (transitions between experiments); latent-structure mixing is classical —
see B. G. Lindsay, *Mixture Models: Theory, Geometry and Applications*, IMS NSF-CBMS Regional
Conference Series **5** (1995), §1 (verify §). The iid replication of an experiment is the
product experiment of asymptotic statistics (Le Cam 1986, Ch. 3).
