# Marginals of composite models

How the replication and conditioning operations of the model calculus project back onto their
ingredients:

* `pushforward_condProd_fst` — the covariate marginal of the regression joint law is the
  covariate model;
* `pushforward_condProd_snd` — **the hinge between regression and latent-variable models**: the
  response marginal of the regression joint law is exactly the latent marginalization `mix P K`;
* `condProd_const` — a covariate-free response kernel gives the independent product;
* `pushforward_iid_eval`, `pushforward_iidSeq_eval` — single-coordinate marginals of iid
  replication recover the base model;
* `iid_pushforward` — replication commutes with per-coordinate transformation;
* `pushforward_iidSeq_window` — finite windows of the infinite iid sequence are the `n`-fold
  iid model;
* `iid_indepProd` — iid replication is the constant case of independent replication.

**Reference.** Joint, marginal and conditional model construction: A. C. Davison, *Statistical
Models*, Cambridge University Press, 2003, Chapter 6 (Stochastic Models) (verify §); the product
experiment: L. Le Cam, *Asymptotic Methods in Statistical Decision Theory*, Springer, 1986,
Ch. 3 (verify §).

**Proof formalization notes.** Each lemma is `funext θ` plus one Mathlib brick:
`Measure.fst_compProd` / `Measure.snd_compProd` for the regression marginals,
`Measure.compProd_const` for the product case, `Measure.pi_map_eval` /
`Measure.infinitePi_map_eval` for coordinate marginals (the probability hypothesis makes the
spectator factors have total mass one), `Measure.pi_map_pi` for `iid_pushforward`. Statements
are phrased through the area's `pushforward` so downstream identifiability transfer applies
verbatim.

**Bibliographic comments.** The observation that the second marginal of a disintegrated joint
law is the mixture of the conditional over the marginal is the measure-theoretic form of the
law of total probability; in the statistical-model reading it identifies regression models
observed without covariates with latent-variable (mixture) models — see B. G. Lindsay, *Mixture
Models* (IMS, 1995), §1 (verify §).

Mathlib's `Measure.pi` API is σ-finite throughout (`Measure.pi_pi`, `Measure.pi_eq` and
`Measure.pi_map_pi` all demand `SigmaFinite`), and `SFinite μ` does not supply
`SigmaFinite (μ.map T)`; only the inequality `≤` is free (the preimage of a `𝓨`-box is a
`𝓧`-box of the same price, so every `𝓨`-cover converts, but not conversely). -/
