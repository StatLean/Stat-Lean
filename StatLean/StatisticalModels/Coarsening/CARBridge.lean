# The CAR bridge — MAR missingness is coarsening at random

**C6.** The model-level missingness mechanism of this slice satisfies the semiparametric
layer's coarsening-at-random predicate: for a MAR mechanism, the full-data law disintegrates
over the observed data through an explicit reconstruction kernel concentrated on the
coarsening fibres —
`IsMAR ρ → IsCoarseningAtRandom missingObserve (fullLaw Q ρ)`
(`AsymptoticStatistics.Operators.CAR.IsCoarseningAtRandom`, imported — never redefined).
This is the bridge that lets the missing-data *models* of this slice consume the
semiparametric observed-data theory (observed tangent spaces, information-loss operator,
influence-function lifts) of vdV §25.6.

**Scope honesty.** `IsCoarseningAtRandom` is a *single-measure* predicate, and on standard
Borel carriers a single-measure CAR disintegration exists for essentially any mechanism (see
the remark in `Operators/CAR.lean`) — so the Prop alone does not isolate MAR. Moreover the
kernel built here (`carKernel Q`) depends on the outcome law `Q` through `Q.condKernel`, so
it is *not* θ-free in a parametric reading. The value of this theorem is the explicit,
slice-wise reconstruction kernel — deterministic recovery on complete cases, a `Y ∣ X`
redraw on incomplete ones — whose correctness on the incomplete slice is exactly what MAR
buys. The substantive family-level bridge (one θ-free reconstruction kernel serving every
outcome law simultaneously, the form the semiparametric theory actually consumes) is a named
future debt (`D-C1`).

This file deliberately imports another area's concept layer (`Operators.CAR`) — the
sanctioned adapter exception, same pattern as `Adapters/`.

**Proof formalization notes.** The reconstruction kernel is glued by `Kernel.piecewise` on
the clopen observed event `{o | o.2.1 = true}`: on the complete-case slice the full datum is
recovered deterministically (`(x, r, ry) ↦ (x, ry, true)`); on the incomplete slice the
outcome is redrawn from the conditional law of `Y` given `X` under `Q` (`Q.condKernel`,
disintegrating over the standard Borel factor `ℝ`) — MAR is exactly what makes the
`Y ∣ X, R = 0` conditional equal the `Y ∣ X` conditional. The bind identity is verified
slice-by-slice against `Ignorability.observedLaw_restrict_true/false`; the fibre condition is
definitional on the deterministic slice and holds by construction on the other. Designated
XL theorem of the batch — the single allowed carry.

**Bibliographic comments.** That MAR is the single-outcome instance of CAR is `HR91`'s
founding observation; the kernel-disintegration formulation is Gill–van der Laan–Robins
(1997), which is also the form the `Operators.CAR` layer fixes.
