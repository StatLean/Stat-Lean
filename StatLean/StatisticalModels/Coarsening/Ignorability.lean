# Ignorability — the observed-data law factorizes over the two slices

**C5 (Rubin's factorization, exact measure form).** Under a MAR mechanism with propensity
`π(x) = ρ' x {true}`, the observed-data law decomposes over the response indicator:

* complete-case slice (`r = true`): the outcome law reweighted by the propensity —
  `Q.withDensity (π ∘ fst)` transported by `(x, y) ↦ (x, true, y)`;
* incomplete slice (`r = false`): the covariate marginal reweighted by `1 − π` —
  `(Q.map fst).withDensity (1 − π)` transported by `x ↦ (x, false, 0)`;

and the two slices reassemble the observed law. This is the measure-level content of Rubin's
observed-data likelihood `[f_θ(x,y) π_φ(x)]^r [(∫ f_θ(x,y)\,dy)(1−π_φ(x))]^{1−r}` — the
θ-part and the φ-part sit in different factors, so the mechanism is *ignorable* for
likelihood inference about the outcome law: the dominated corollary exhibits the
complete-case density as exactly `f · (π ∘ fst)`.

*Book vs Lean:* the slice decomposition is stated for **arbitrary** outcome laws — no
domination, no densities; Rubin's dominated formulation is the corollary, strictly weaker.
The distinctness-of-parameters clause and the Bayesian reading of ignorability are named
future work (D-C4). The formal agreement lemma with the semiparametric
`Examples.MARMean.marMean_Ψ` estimand (C4) is deliberately not stated: it would import an
assembly-layer example file for a near-`rfl` transport; the connection is documented at
`Coarsening.IPW` instead (deviation recorded in the batch ledger).

**Reference.** D. B. Rubin, "Inference and missing data," *Biometrika* **63** (1976),
581–592, §2–3 (the ignorability theorem) (`Rubin76 §2–3`); R. J. A. Little and D. B. Rubin,
*Statistical Analysis with Missing Data*, 3rd ed., Wiley, 2019, §6.2 (verify §) (`LR §6.2`).

**Proof formalization notes.** Both slice lemmas are `Measure.ext` computations: unfold
`observedLaw`/`fullLaw` through `Measure.map_apply`/`Measure.compProd_apply` (mind the
un-β-reduced integrands — `simp_rw`/`change`), split the event by the Bool coordinate, and
evaluate the inner Bernoulli integral (`Coarsening.Basic.lintegral_bool`). On the `false`
slice the masked coordinate is the constant `0`, whence the pushforward from the covariate
marginal alone.

**Bibliographic comments.** Ignorability is Rubin's (1976) — the observation that under MAR
(+ distinct parameters) the missingness mechanism drops out of the likelihood; the
slice-decomposition form is the standard modern proof (LR §6.2).
