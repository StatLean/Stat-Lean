# Worked instance: a location family under right censoring

The second Core regression test, seeding the Survival slice: a location family on `ℝ` (a
nonparametric-in-the-carrier model — the base law `μ₀` is arbitrary), the **right-censoring
observation kernel** carrying a full event time `t` to the censored readout
`(t ∧ C, 1{t ≤ C})` with `C ∼ ν` independent, and the destroy-direction identifiability
transfer instantiated: identification from censored data implies identification from complete
data.

**Reference.** Location families: TPE2 §1.1, §3.1 (verify §). The random-censorship readout
`(T ∧ C, 1{T ≤ C})`: E. L. Kaplan and P. Meier, "Nonparametric estimation from incomplete
observations," *J. Amer. Statist. Assoc.* **53** (1958), 457–481, §2 (verify §).

**Proof formalization notes.** The censoring kernel is built compositionally —
`(deterministic id) ×ₖ (const ν)` mapped through `(t, c) ↦ (t ∧ c, decide (t ≤ c))` — so its
measurability is inherited, never proved by hand; its pointwise form and Markov property are
the two lemmas. Tie convention: `Δ = decide (T ≤ C)` (ties count as events) — Book-vs-Lean
note: the classical treatments assume `P(T = C) = 0`, where the convention is immaterial.
The Survival slice reuses this kernel; here it only exercises `observe` and the transfer
theorems.

**Bibliographic comments.** Random censorship as an explicit observation mechanism goes back
to Kaplan–Meier 1958 and J. Gilbert's 1962 thesis; the kernel packaging is ours.

/-- The location family of a base law `μ₀`: parameter `θ` shifts the law by `θ`
(TPE2 §3.1 (verify §)). Arbitrary base law — the model structure, not a parametric family. -/
