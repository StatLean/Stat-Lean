# Local independence — the bridge between factor models and graphical models

`BKM`'s **axiom of conditional (local) independence**, Eq. (1.9): once the latent factors are
held fixed, the observed coordinates carry no dependence left over. In the linear model
`x = μ + Λ y + e` with Gaussian specific factors and a **diagonal** specific-factor covariance
`Ψ`, this is a theorem rather than an axiom, and it is the point at which the two new areas
meet: the conclusion is stated with `GraphicalModels.CondIndep`, the conditional-independence
predicate of the graphical slice, applied to the factor model of `FactorModels.Defs`.

* `latentObsJointLaw P F E` — the joint law of the pair `(y, x)`, i.e. the latent law composed
  with the measurement kernel; `latentObsJointLaw_fst` / `latentObsJointLaw_snd` identify its two
  marginals as `F` and `factorLaw P F E`;

  *Coordinate order.* This is the **latent-first** joint law, because everything here
  conditions *on* the factor. `FactorScores.factorJointLaw` is the **observation-first** joint
  law of the same model, because there one conditions on the observation to obtain `y ∣ x`.
  The two are each other's `Prod.swap` pushforward; the names are kept distinct so a reader is
  never in doubt about which coordinate is being conditioned on.
* `indepFun_eval_measurementKernel` — at a **fixed** factor value, two distinct observed
  coordinates are independent (`BKM` Eq. (1.9), pairwise form);
* `iIndepFun_eval_measurementKernel` — the **family** version: at a fixed factor value the
  whole family `(x₁, …, x_p)` is jointly independent;
* `map_measurementKernel_eq_pi` — `BKM` Eq. (1.9) verbatim, as the product formula
  `g(x ∣ y) = ∏ᵢ gᵢ(xᵢ ∣ y)` with `gᵢ(· ∣ y) = N((μ + Λy)ᵢ, ψᵢ)`;
* **`condIndep_eval_latentObsJointLaw` (HEADLINE)** — local independence in the graphical
  vocabulary: `xᵢ ⫫ xⱼ ∣ y` under the joint law, for `i ≠ j`;
* `factorCovariance_apply_of_oneFactor`, `factorCovariance_apply_ne_zero_of_oneFactor`,
  `not_indepFun_eval_gaussianFactorModel` — **the contrast**. After the factor is marginalised
  out, the off-diagonal entry of `Σ = Λ Φ Λᵀ + Ψ` is `λᵢ Φ λⱼ`, which is non-zero as soon as
  two loadings on a common factor are; so the observed coordinates are *dependent* even though
  they were conditionally independent given the factor.

**The moral.** Conditional independence *given the latent variables* and dependence *in the
observed marginal* are two different statements, and a factor model is precisely a device that
produces the second from the first: the common factor manufactures the observed correlations,
and `Ψ` diagonal says that nothing else does. A graphical model describes dependence by which
conditional independences hold **among the observed variables themselves**; a factor model
describes it by positing latent variables that **explain the dependence away**. The two are
therefore complementary descriptions of the same phenomenon, and this file is the
one place where both vocabularies are used in a single statement.

**Reference.** D. Bartholomew, M. Knott, and I. Moustaki, *Latent Variable Models and Factor
Analysis: A Unified Approach*, 3rd ed., Wiley, 2011, §1.4, **Eq. (1.9)** (p. 7):
`g(x ∣ y) = ∏_{i=1}^{p} gᵢ(xᵢ ∣ y)` — note this is a **chapter 1** equation, not a chapter 2
one — together with the surrounding passage (pp. 7–8): "if the dependencies among the *x*s are
induced by a set of latent variables **y** then when all **y**s are accounted for, the *x*s
will be independent if all the **y**s are held fixed. If this were not so the set of **y**s
would not be *complete*"; and, on p. 8, "It is better regarded as a definition of what we mean
when we say that the set of latent variables **y** is complete. In other words, that **y** is
sufficient to explain the dependencies among the *x*s." Eq. (1.10) (p. 8),
`f(x) = ∫ h(y) ∏ᵢ gᵢ(xᵢ ∣ y) dy`, is the marginalisation that the contrast section is about.
The linear-Gaussian instance is §3.2, Eq. (3.1)–(3.3) and Eq. (3.12) (`BKM`).

**Proof formalization notes.**

*Book vs Lean, three points.*

1. **Diagonality of `Ψ` is only uncorrelatedness in general; Gaussianity is what upgrades it to
   independence.** `BKM` Eq. (1.9) is an assumption about the conditional *density*, and
   Eq. (3.1) supplies it by taking `x ∣ y ∼ N_p(μ + Λ y, Ψ)` with `Ψ` diagonal. Our statements
   therefore fix the specific-factor law to be `multivariateGaussian 0 Ψ`: for a non-Gaussian
   `E` with diagonal covariance the conclusion is **false**, and no theorem below is stated at
   that generality. Diagonality alone is `HasDiagonalUniqueness`; it is not enough.
2. **The conditioning variable is the factor itself, not another block of coordinates.** So the
   statement uses the general `GraphicalModels.CondIndep μ f g h` and *not* the contracted
   `CondIndepCoords`, whose three arguments are all blocks of one vector.
3. **The family version lives at the kernel level.** `GraphicalModels.CondIndep` is a binary
   predicate, and no *family* conditional-independence predicate (an `iIndepFun` conditioned
   on a third variable) is available. `iIndepFun_eval_measurementKernel`
   and `map_measurementKernel_eq_pi` therefore state the joint independence of all `p`
   coordinates **under the conditional law at each factor value** — which is exactly what
   `BKM` Eq. (1.9) asserts, since (1.9) is a statement about `g(· ∣ y)` for each `y`.

*Junk values.* `multivariateGaussian m S` collapses to `Measure.dirac m` off the
positive-semidefinite cone, so every statement carries `P.uniqueCov.PosSemidef` (or
`IsProperFactorParams`) explicitly; without it the "conditional law" is a point mass and the
covariance statements are false.

**Bibliographic comments.** The conditional-independence formulation of a latent-variable model
is P. F. Lazarsfeld's, in S. A. Stouffer et al., *Measurement and Prediction*, Princeton Univ.
Press, 1950, ch. 10–11, where it appears as the *axiom of local independence* for latent
structure analysis; `BKM` §1.4 is the modern statement, and `BKM` p. 8 makes the point recorded
above, that local independence is better read as a *definition of completeness* of the latent
vector than as a testable assumption. The observation that a common factor manufactures
observed correlation is Spearman's original argument for a general factor (C. Spearman,
"'General intelligence', objectively determined and measured," *Amer. J. Psychol.* **15**
(1904), 201–292): the *tetrad differences* vanish exactly because the observed covariances
factor through a single latent variable. The complementary reading — describing dependence by
conditional independences among the observed variables — is the graphical-models programme of
S. L. Lauritzen, *Graphical Models*, Clarendon Press, 1996.

`factorLaw` has already marginalised the factor away.

/-! ### The headline — local independence in the graphical vocabulary -/

/-- **HEADLINE — local independence** (`BKM` §1.4, Eq. (1.9); linear-Gaussian instance §3.2,
Eq. (3.1)). In the Gaussian linear factor model with a **diagonal** specific-factor covariance
`Ψ`, two distinct observed coordinates are conditionally independent given the latent factor:
`xᵢ ⫫ xⱼ ∣ y` under the joint law of `(y, x)`.

This is the bridge between the two areas: the conclusion is `GraphicalModels.CondIndep`, the
disintegration predicate of the graphical slice, and the model is `FactorModels.latentObsJointLaw`.
The witnesses `CondIndep` asks for are the two coordinate marginals of the measurement kernel.

*Book vs Lean:* `BKM` Eq. (1.9) states local independence for the whole family and for an
arbitrary conditional density; here it is a **theorem** in the Gaussian linear model, in the
pairwise form that `CondIndep` can express. The family form is
`iIndepFun_eval_measurementKernel` / `map_measurementKernel_eq_pi`, stated at the kernel level
for want of a family conditional-independence predicate. -/

/-! ### The contrast — dependence in the observed marginal

Local independence says nothing about the *observed* law. Marginalising the factor out
(`BKM` Eq. (1.10), `latentObsJointLaw_snd`) leaves `Σ = Λ Φ Λᵀ + Ψ`, whose off-diagonal entries
are the common part alone — the specific factors contribute only to the diagonal. In the
one-factor model `Σᵢⱼ = λᵢ φ λⱼ`, so any two coordinates loading on the same factor are
correlated, hence (being jointly Gaussian) dependent. This is the precise sense in which a
common factor *manufactures* the observed dependence that local independence has removed from
the conditional law. -/
