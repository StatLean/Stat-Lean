# Conditional independence — the disintegration predicate

The keystone of the graphical-models area: a conditional-independence predicate
`X ⫫ Y ∣ Z` that works on **arbitrary** measurable spaces, with no standard-Borel
side condition, so that the same vocabulary carries the discrete (mass-function) theory,
the Gaussian theory, and any future semiparametric/causal consumer.

Rather than *invoking* a regular conditional distribution, we *assert that a product
disintegration exists*.

* `CondIndep μ f g h` — the joint law of `(h, (f, g))` under `μ` factors as
  `(law of h) ⊗ₘ (κ ×ₖ η)` for two Markov kernels `κ`, `η` out of the conditioning space;
* `CondIndep.symm` — Lauritzen (C1), *symmetry*: swap the two kernels;
* `CondIndep.comp_of_sfinite` — Lauritzen (C2), *decomposition* in its functional form
  `U = φ(X), W = ψ(Y)`: push the kernels through measurable maps. The statement
  `CondIndep.comp`, which carried no `[SFinite (μ.map h)]` hypothesis, was **false** and has been
  **deleted**; see the section *"(C2) without s-finiteness — deleted, and why"* below, the
  machine-checked `CondIndep.CompCounterexample.comp_is_false`, and the proved repair;
* `CondIndep.const_right` / `condIndep_const_of_indepFun` — conditioning on a **constant**
  is ordinary independence, in both directions;
* `condIndep_congr_law` — the predicate depends only on the **joint law** of the triple, so it
  transfers across reindexings and marginalisations of a model;
* `condIndep_of_subsingleton_left` — a **degenerate** argument (subsingleton value space, i.e.
  the subvector on an empty block) is conditionally independent of everything;
* `condIndepFun_of_condIndep` — the **export bridge** to Mathlib's
  `ProbabilityTheory.CondIndepFun`.

Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1996, §3.1, pp. 28–29, equations (3.1)–(3.7) — in particular the
symmetric density identity (3.2)
`f_{XYZ}(x,y,z) f_Z(z) = f_{XZ}(x,z) f_{YZ}(y,z)` and the factorisation criterion (3.6)
`f(x,y,z) = h(x,z) k(y,z)`; the properties (C1)–(C4) are the unnumbered labelled list on
p. 29 (`Lauritzen §3.1`).

**Proof formalization notes.** *Book vs Lean:* Lauritzen states conditional independence
through densities with respect to a product measure (3.1); we state the equivalent
measure-theoretic disintegration, which needs no dominating measure and no standard Borel
hypothesis. Two consequences of the chosen shape are worth recording.

* Symmetry (C1) and the functional form of decomposition (C2) are **structural** — swap the
  kernel pair, push the kernels forward. (C1) does hold in this generality; (C2) does *not*,
  because `⊗ₘ` is `0` by fiat when the conditioning law is not s-finite
  (`MeasureTheory.Measure.compProd_of_not_sfinite`), and the swap of (C1) is an involution while
  a general `φ` is not — see `CondIndep.comp_of_sfinite`. Weak union (C3),
  contraction (C4) and intersection (C5) need essential uniqueness of disintegrations and are
  therefore proved in the discrete layer only, never assumed here.
* `const_right` genuinely needs `IsProbabilityMeasure μ`, not merely `IsFiniteMeasure μ`: for
  a finite measure of total mass `m`, the disintegration identity gives
  `μ.map (f, g) = m · (κ c).prod (η c)` while `(μ.map f).prod (μ.map g) = m² · (κ c).prod (η c)`,
  so the two agree exactly when `m ∈ {0, 1}`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The axiomatic treatment of conditional independence as a
free-standing relation is A. P. Dawid, "Conditional independence in statistical theory,"

weak union / contraction / intersection* for the properties Lauritzen labels (C1)–(C5) are

kernel (disintegration) formulation is the modern regular-conditional-probability reading of
Lauritzen's density identity (3.2).

/-- **Conditional independence** `f ⫫ g ∣ h` under `μ` (Lauritzen §3.1, p. 28): the joint law
of `(h, (f, g))` disintegrates over `h` as a *product* of two Markov kernels.

Edge behaviour: the predicate quantifies existentially over the disintegrating kernels, so it
is meaningful for an arbitrary measure `μ` on an arbitrary measurable space — no
standard-Borel hypothesis, no dominating measure. For `μ = 0` it holds vacuously (both sides
are `0`), and for non-measurable `f`, `g` or `h` it is a statement about the junk pushforward
`Measure.map`, which is `0` there; substantive theorems therefore carry explicit measurability
hypotheses. -/

/-! ### (C2) without s-finiteness — deleted, and why

There used to be a declaration `CondIndep.comp` here: Lauritzen (C2) in functional form
(`X ⫫ Y ∣ Z` and `U = φ(X)`, `W = ψ(Y)` imply `U ⫫ W ∣ Z`) stated with **no** hypothesis on
`μ.map h`. **That statement is false, and has been deleted.** What was deleted is exactly

```
theorem CondIndep.comp {α' β' : Type*} [MeasurableSpace α'] [MeasurableSpace β']
    {φ : α → α'} {ψ : β → β'} (hφ : Measurable φ) (hψ : Measurable ψ)
    (hci : CondIndep μ f g h) : CondIndep μ (φ ∘ f) (ψ ∘ g) h
```

and `CondIndep.CompCounterexample.comp_is_false` below derives `False` from precisely that
statement (in `Type`-universe form), so the refutation is machine-checked, not narrative.

*The counterexample.* It lives in the `⊗ₘ`-junk regime that the module docstring warns about:

* `Pt := ℝ × Bool` carries the σ-algebra `MeasurableSpace.comap fst' ⊤`, which sees only the
  first coordinate, and `mu := ∑ₓ dirac (x, true)`;
* `mu` is **not s-finite** (the uncountably many fibres `fst' ⁻¹' {x}` all have positive mass,
  contradicting `MeasureTheory.Measure.countable_meas_pos_of_disjoint_iUnion`), so *every*
  `mu ⊗ₘ K` collapses to `0` by `MeasureTheory.Measure.compProd_of_not_sfinite`;
* `snd'` is not a.e. measurable (`mu` has no nonempty null set), so the law of
  `(id, (snd', snd'))` is the junk `0` as well: the hypothesis `CondIndep mu snd' snd' id`
  **holds**, with any pair of Markov kernels as witnesses;
* transforming by the constant `φ = ψ = (fun _ => ())` makes the triple `(id, ((), ()))`
  measurable, so its law has mass `mu Set.univ ≠ 0` — while the right-hand side is still `0`.
  The conclusion `CondIndep mu (φ ∘ snd') (ψ ∘ snd') id` therefore **fails**.

The gap is not an artefact of the proof method: it is the statement.
`CondIndep.comp_of_sfinite` below is the same theorem with the one missing hypothesis
`[SFinite (μ.map h)]` restored, and is fully proved; it is free at every intended instance,
since `SFinite (μ.map h)` is an instance whenever `SFinite μ` is (in particular for any
probability or σ-finite `μ`). -/

/-- **(C2), decomposition in functional form** (Lauritzen p. 29: `X ⫫ Y ∣ Z` and `U = φ(X)`
imply `U ⫫ Y ∣ Z`; Pearl 1988 calls it *decomposition*): measurable transformations of the two
independent arguments preserve conditional independence. Structural — push each kernel forward
through the corresponding map.

This is the **repaired** form of the deleted `CondIndep.comp`: identical to it except for the
one hypothesis that makes it true; see the section above and
`CondIndep.CompCounterexample.comp_is_false`.

No measurability of `f`, `g`, `h` is needed: when the joint map is not a.e. measurable, its law
is `0`, `MeasureTheory.Measure.fst_compProd` forces `μ.map h = 0`, and the transformed law is `0`
as well (either `μ = 0`, or `h` is not a.e. measurable and neither is the transformed triple). -/

This is the transfer principle that lets a block statement about the canonical coordinate vector
of `N(m, Σ)` be re-read on a *reindexed* or *marginalised* Gaussian, whose coordinate blocks
have the same joint law but live on a different sample space.

The only content is that the conditioning law `μ.map h` is itself a marginal of the joint law

/-! ### Refutation of the deleted `CondIndep.comp`

A machine-checked counterexample to the deleted `CondIndep.comp`, living in the `⊗ₘ`-junk
regime: the conditioning law is not s-finite, so *every* `⊗ₘ` on the right-hand side is `0`,
while a constant transformation of the two variables turns a non-a.e.-measurable triple into a
measurable one and so makes the left-hand side nonzero. See the section *"(C2) without
s-finiteness — deleted, and why"* above for the narrative, and `comp_is_false` for the
derivation of `False` from the deleted statement. -/
