# Coordinate subvectors — conditional independence between blocks of variables

A graphical model is a statement about a random vector `X : Ω → V → α` indexed by the vertex
set `V`: the blocks `X_A`, `X_B`, `X_C` for finite vertex sets `A`, `B`, `C`. This file fixes
the subvector operation and specialises `CondIndep` to it, so that everything downstream
(separation, the Markov properties, the discrete and Gaussian characterisations) speaks a
single vocabulary.

* `coords A X` — the subvector `X_A = (X_v)_{v ∈ A}`, a random element of `A → α`;
* `measurable_coords` — a subvector of a measurable vector is measurable
  (`Finset.measurable_restrict`);
* `coords_apply`, `restrict₂_comp_coords` — the two rewriting facts the later files need:
  a coordinate of a subvector is a coordinate, and restricting a bigger subvector to a smaller
  index set gives the smaller subvector;
* `CondIndepCoords μ X A B C` — `X_A ⫫ X_B ∣ X_C`;
* `CondIndepCoords.symm` / `CondIndepCoords.decomposition` — the two graphoid properties that
  are structural at this level, inherited from `CondIndep.symm` / `CondIndep.comp`. **The
  decomposition statement is false as frozen**, exactly as `CondIndep.comp` is — see its
  docstring, the machine-checked
  `CondIndepCoords.DecompositionCounterexample.decomposition_is_false`, and the proved repair
  `CondIndepCoords.decomposition_of_sfinite`.

**Reference.** S. L. Lauritzen, *Graphical Models*, Oxford Statistical Science Series 17,
Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1996, §3.1, pp. 28–30 — conditional independence between blocks of a
random vector, and the properties (C1)–(C2) used here (`Lauritzen §3.1`).

**Proof formalization notes.** *Book vs Lean:* Lauritzen writes `X_A` for the restriction of a
vector indexed by a finite vertex set; the Lean carrier is `Finset.restrict`, whose value type
`↥A → α` is indexed by the coercion of the `Finset` to a subtype. Consequently the *type* of
`X_A` depends on `A`, and set-level manipulations (`A ⊆ B`, `A ∪ B`) become explicit transport
maps `Finset.restrict₂` rather than silent equalities — this is why `restrict₂_comp_coords` is
load-bearing and why decomposition at this level is an instance of `CondIndep.comp` rather
than a rewriting step.

The index type `V` is *not* assumed finite here: only the three blocks are finite sets, so the
vocabulary also covers infinite graphs. Finiteness of `V` enters only where the complement
`Finset.univ \ A` is formed (the Markov properties).

**Bibliographic comments.** The block notation `X_A` and the reading of a graphical model as a
family of conditional independence statements between blocks is Lauritzen's throughout;
the names for the properties (C1)–(C5) are J. Pearl's, *Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent
Systems*, Morgan Kaufmann, 1988.

singleton, so `coords ∅ X` is the (a.s. constant) trivial variable — conditioning on it is
conditioning on nothing, which is what the `∅`-conditioning corollaries in

**REFUTED AS FROZEN — this statement is FALSE; the `sorry` is deliberate.** Being an instance of
`CondIndep.comp`, it inherits that theorem's falsity (see its docstring): `⊗ₘ` is `0` by fiat
when the conditioning law is not s-finite, so the frozen statement equates a possibly nonzero
law with `0`. `CondIndepCoords.DecompositionCounterexample.decomposition_is_false` is a
machine-checked derivation of `False` from this very statement; the instance is
`V := Bool`, `α := Ω := CondIndep.CompCounterexample.Pt`, `μ := mu`, with the random vector
`XX` whose coordinate `false` is the identity (measurable, and with a non-s-finite law) and
whose coordinate `true` reads the invisible second coordinate of `Pt` (not a.e. measurable),
and with the blocks `A = B = ∅ ⊆ D = {true}`, `C = {false}`.

`CondIndepCoords.decomposition_of_sfinite` below is the same theorem with the one missing
hypothesis `[SFinite (μ.map (coords C X))]` restored, and is fully proved; it is free at every
intended instance, since `SFinite (μ.map _)` is an instance whenever `μ` is s-finite (in
particular for any probability measure). Repairing the frozen statement is a scope decision and
is left to the user. -/
