# Coordinate subvectors — conditional independence between blocks of variables

A graphical model is a statement about a random vector `X : Ω → V → α` indexed by the vertex
set `V`: the blocks `X_A`, `X_B`, `X_C` for finite vertex sets `A`, `B`, `C`. This file fixes
the subvector operation and specialises `CondIndep` to it, so that everything downstream
(separation, the Markov properties, the discrete and Gaussian characterisations) speaks a
single vocabulary.

* `coords A X` — the subvector `X_A = (X_v)_{v ∈ A}`, a random element of `A → α`;
* `measurable_coords` — a subvector of a measurable vector is measurable
  (`Finset.measurable_restrict`);
* `coords_apply`, `restrict₂_comp_coords` — the two rewriting facts the later files need:
  a coordinate of a subvector is a coordinate, and restricting a bigger subvector to a smaller
  index set gives the smaller subvector;
* `CondIndepCoords μ X A B C` — `X_A ⫫ X_B ∣ X_C`;
* `CondIndepCoords.symm` / `CondIndepCoords.decomposition_of_sfinite` — the two graphoid
  properties that are structural at this level, inherited from `CondIndep.symm` /
  `CondIndep.comp_of_sfinite`. The frozen `CondIndepCoords.decomposition`, which carried no
  s-finiteness hypothesis, was **false** and has been **deleted**, exactly as `CondIndep.comp`
  was — see the section *"(C2) without s-finiteness — deleted, and why"* below and the
  machine-checked `CondIndepCoords.DecompositionCounterexample.decomposition_is_false`;
* `CondIndepCoords.of_isEmpty_left` — the `A = ∅` edge case, a theorem rather than a remark:
  the subvector on an empty block is conditionally independent of everything.

**Reference.** S. L. Lauritzen, *Graphical Models*, Oxford Statistical Science Series 17,
Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1996, §3.1, pp. 28–30 — conditional independence between blocks of a
random vector, and the properties (C1)–(C2) used here (`Lauritzen §3.1`).

**Proof formalization notes.** *Book vs Lean:* Lauritzen writes `X_A` for the restriction of a
vector indexed by a finite vertex set; the Lean carrier is `Finset.restrict`, whose value type
`↥A → α` is indexed by the coercion of the `Finset` to a subtype. Consequently the *type* of
`X_A` depends on `A`, and set-level manipulations (`A ⊆ B`, `A ∪ B`) become explicit transport
maps `Finset.restrict₂` rather than silent equalities — this is why `restrict₂_comp_coords` is
load-bearing and why decomposition at this level is an instance of `CondIndep.comp_of_sfinite`
rather than a rewriting step.

The index type `V` is *not* assumed finite here: only the three blocks are finite sets, so the
vocabulary also covers infinite graphs. Finiteness of `V` enters only where the complement
`Finset.univ \ A` is formed (the Markov properties).

**Bibliographic comments.** The block notation `X_A` and the reading of a graphical model as a
family of conditional independence statements between blocks is Lauritzen's throughout;
the names for the properties (C1)–(C5) are J. Pearl's, *Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent
Systems*, Morgan Kaufmann, 1988.

/-! ### (C2) without s-finiteness — deleted, and why

There used to be a declaration `CondIndepCoords.decomposition` here: Lauritzen (C2) at the
coordinate level, stated with **no** hypothesis on the conditioning law, and carrying a `sorry`.
**That statement is false, and has been deleted rather than left `sorry`ed** — a `sorry` on a
statement known to be false is indistinguishable, in any census, from honest unfinished work.
What was deleted is exactly

```
theorem CondIndepCoords.decomposition (hBD : B ⊆ D) (hci : CondIndepCoords μ X A D C) :
    CondIndepCoords μ X A B C
```

and `CondIndepCoords.DecompositionCounterexample.decomposition_is_false` below derives `False`
from precisely that statement, so the refutation is machine-checked, not narrative.

*Why it is false.* Being an instance of the (likewise deleted, likewise false) `CondIndep.comp`,
it inherits that theorem's falsity: `⊗ₘ` is `0` by fiat when the conditioning law is not
s-finite (`MeasureTheory.Measure.compProd_of_not_sfinite`), so the statement equates a possibly
nonzero law with `0`. The witness is `V := Bool`, `α := Ω := CondIndep.CompCounterexample.Pt`,
`μ := mu`, with the random vector `XX` whose coordinate `false` is the identity (measurable, and
with a non-s-finite law) and whose coordinate `true` reads the invisible second coordinate of
`Pt` (not a.e. measurable), and with the blocks `A = B = ∅ ⊆ D = {true}`, `C = {false}`.

`CondIndepCoords.decomposition_of_sfinite` below is the same theorem with the one missing
hypothesis `[SFinite (μ.map (coords C X))]` restored, and is fully proved; it is free at every
intended instance, since `SFinite (μ.map _)` is an instance whenever `μ` is s-finite (in
particular for any probability measure), and it is what every consumer in this area now uses. -/

/-- **(C2), decomposition** at the coordinate level (Lauritzen p. 29): dropping variables from
the second block preserves conditional independence. An instance of `CondIndep.comp_of_sfinite`
with the transport map `Finset.restrict₂`, whose defining equation is `restrict₂_comp_coords`.

This is the **repaired** form of the deleted `CondIndepCoords.decomposition`: identical to it
except for the one hypothesis that makes it true; see the section above. -/

    -- which is false without it; see `CondIndep.comp_of_sfinite`

    measurable_id (Finset.measurable_restrict₂ (X := fun _ => α) hBD) hci

/-- **The `A = ∅` edge case is a theorem, not a convention**: the subvector on an empty index
block takes values in a singleton type, so it is conditionally independent of every other block
given every third block. Together with `CondIndepCoords.symm` this covers both degenerate blocks
of `Undirected.Markov.IsGlobalMarkov`, whose definition quantifies over *all* disjoint triples —
which is what lets a model class supply (G) from Theorem 3.7's nonempty-blocks form.

An instance of `condIndep_of_subsingleton_left`: `↥(∅ : Finset V) → α` is a singleton type
(`IsEmpty` domain), and the other block's subvector is measurable by `measurable_coords`. -/
