# Semi-graphoids and graphoids — the abstract conditional-independence calculus

Lauritzen's properties (C1)–(C5) of conditional independence, abstracted away from probability
and stated for an **arbitrary ternary relation** `ci : Finset V → Finset V → Finset V → Prop`
on index blocks. Reading `ci A B C` as "`X_A ⫫ X_B ∣ X_C`":

* `IsSemigraphoid ci` — (C1) symmetry, (C2) decomposition, (C3) weak union, (C4) contraction;
* `IsGraphoid ci` — a semi-graphoid that also satisfies (C5) intersection;
* the derived combinators — left-handed versions of each axiom, the monotone form of
  decomposition, the `∅`-conditioning corollaries, and the block-splitting equivalence
  `IsSemigraphoid.union_iff`, which packages (C2)+(C3)+(C4) into a single `↔`.

**Why an abstract relation.** This is Lauritzen's own observation, not an invention of ours:
the remark following Proposition 3.4 (p. 33) states that the implications
global ⇒ local ⇒ pairwise Markov "only depend on the properties (C1)–(C4) of conditional
independence and hence hold for any semi-graphoid", and the remark following Theorem 3.7 says
its proof "applies to any graphoid". Abstracting therefore lets the Markov hierarchy be proved
**once**, with each model class (discrete masses, Gaussian precision, our general
`CondIndep`) supplying an instance.

**Disjointness is the book's convention, not a Lean artefact.** Lauritzen states (C1)–(C5)
for *disjoint* subsets of the variable set, and Pearl's semi-graphoid is likewise a relation on
disjoint triples; every axiom field below therefore carries pairwise disjointness of the blocks
occurring in it. This makes `IsSemigraphoid` **faithful** to the book rather than a weakened
version of it — a disjointness-free structure would demand strictly more of every instance than
Lauritzen, Pearl, or our two intended instances (the discrete mass relation and the Gaussian
precision relation) can deliver, since overlapping `A ∩ B ≠ ∅` forces the shared coordinates to
be degenerate given `C`. The hypotheses are payable by the consumer: for the `local ⇒ pairwise`
implication the instantiation is `A = {i}`, `B = {j}`, `C = ne(i)`,
`D = univ \ ({i, j} ∪ ne(i))`, pairwise disjoint precisely because `j ∉ ne(i)` is
non-adjacency, with `C ∪ D = univ \ {i, j}`.

**Reference.** S. L. Lauritzen, *Graphical Models*, Oxford Statistical Science Series 17,
Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1996: the properties (C1)–(C4) are the unnumbered labelled list on
p. 29 and (C5) is on p. 30; the terms *semi-graphoid* ((C1)–(C4)) and *graphoid* ((C1)–(C5))
are defined in prose on p. 30. Proposition 3.1 (p. 29) is the sufficient condition for (C5):
a strictly positive continuous joint density with respect to a product measure. The
justification for abstracting is the remark after Proposition 3.4 (p. 33) and the remark after
Theorem 3.7 (`Lauritzen §3.1`).

**Proof formalization notes.** *Book vs Lean, three deliberate differences.*

1. **Names.** Lauritzen never uses the words *symmetry*, *decomposition*, *weak union*,
   *contraction*, *intersection* — those are Pearl's (1988). We use Pearl's names for the
   fields, because they are the standard ones, and attribute the content to Lauritzen
   (C1)–(C5).
2. **Disjointness spelled out.** Lauritzen carries "disjoint subsets" as a standing convention
   in the surrounding prose; Lean has no standing conventions, so each field lists the
   `Disjoint` facts it needs, in alphabetical pair order `hAB, hAC, hAD, hBC, hBD, hCD`.
   Only what a field actually needs is required — `decomposition` omits `hBD`, since dropping
   `D` from `B ∪ D` never produces a triple in which `B` and `D` both occur.
3. **Functional versus set form of (C2)/(C3).** Lauritzen phrases (C2)/(C3) with a function
   `U = h(X)`; on index blocks the corresponding statement is the set form
   `ci A (B ∪ D) C → ci A B C`, which is what the coordinate-level `CondIndepCoords`
   decomposition (an instance of `CondIndep.comp` with `Finset.restrict₂`) delivers.

**Reuse.** This file is pure order-theoretic logic: no measure theory, no probability, and no
imports beyond `Finset`. Every proof is `exact`/`tauto` from the structure fields plus the
existing `Finset` disjointness API — `Finset.disjoint_union_left` / `Finset.disjoint_union_right`
(`Data/Finset/Basic.lean:76`/`:80`), `Finset.sdiff_disjoint` (`:266`),
`Finset.disjoint_empty_left`/`_right` (`Data/Finset/Disjoint.lean:80`/`:84`), `Disjoint.symm`,
`Disjoint.mono_left`/`mono_right` (`Order/Disjoint.lean:60`/`:78`/`:87`) — together with
`Finset.union_comm`, `Finset.union_eq_right`, `Finset.empty_union` and
`Finset.sdiff_union_of_subset`. Nothing here is a re-derivation.

`IsGraphoid` extends `IsSemigraphoid`, so `hci.toIsSemigraphoid` gives access to every derived
combinator below from a graphoid.

**Bibliographic comments.** The names of the five properties, and the terms *semi-graphoid* and
*graphoid*, are J. Pearl's, *Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems*, Morgan Kaufmann,
1988 (Lauritzen credits him on p. 30); the axiomatic study of conditional independence as a
relation goes back to A. P. Dawid, "Conditional independence in statistical theory,"
*J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B* **41** (1979), 1–31. Two facts justify keeping `IsGraphoid` a
separate, strictly stronger structure. First, (C5) genuinely fails in general: Lauritzen's
counterexample (p. 30) takes `X = Y = Z` with `P{X = 1} = P{X = 0} = 1/2`, where `X ⫫ Y ∣ Z`
and `X ⫫ Z ∣ Y` both hold but `X ⫫ (Y, Z)` does not; Proposition 3.1 recovers (C5) under a
strictly positive density. Second, (C1)–(C4) are sound but **not complete** for probabilistic
conditional independence: M. Studený, "Conditional independence relations have no finite
complete characterization," in *Information Theory, Statistical Decision Functions and Random
Processes* (Trans. 11th Prague Conf., vol. B), Kluwer, 1992, 377–396, shows no finite
axiomatisation exists. So `IsSemigraphoid` is a genuine abstraction of a *sufficient* calculus,
never a characterisation.
