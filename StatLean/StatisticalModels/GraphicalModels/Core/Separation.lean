# Graph separation — the combinatorial side of the Markov properties

`Separates G S A B` says that the vertex set `S` **separates** `A` from `B` in the simple
graph `G`: every walk that starts in `A` and ends in `B` visits a vertex of `S`. This is the
only graph-theoretic input the undirected Markov properties need, and it is the object whose
graphoid calculus mirrors the probabilistic one (Lauritzen's Example 3.2).

* `Separates` — the definition, as a `∀`-statement over `SimpleGraph.Walk`;
* `separates_symm` — separation is symmetric in the two separated blocks;
* `separates_mono_left` / `separates_mono_right` — shrinking either separated block preserves
  separation;
* `separates_of_subset_sep` — growing the separator preserves separation;
* `separates_empty_left` / `separates_empty_right` / `separates_self_left` /
  `separates_self_right` — the degenerate cases (an empty block is separated from anything; a
  block already inside the separator is separated from anything);
* `separates_iff_forall_path` — the bridge to the book's *path*-phrased definition;
* `separates_iff_not_reachable_deleteVerts` and `separates_iff_componentComplMk_ne` — the
  bridge into Mathlib's connectivity API: separation is exactly non-reachability in the graph
  with `S` deleted, equivalently "different connected components outside `S`". These are the
  hinges through which any future connectivity-flavoured result (menger-type statements,
  decomposable graphs) will be proved; they are stated here and proved in a later lane.

**Reference.** S. L. Lauritzen, *Graphical Models*, Oxford Statistical Science Series 17,
Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1996, §2.1.1, p. 6: an *(α, β)-separator* is a set `S` such that
every path from `α` to `β` intersects `S`, and `S` *separates* `A` from `B` when it is an
`(α, β)`-separator for every `α ∈ A`, `β ∈ B`. Both are **unnumbered** definitions in that
section — there is no "Definition 2.x" to cite. Example 3.2 (p. 31) records that graph
separation, read as the ternary relation `(A, B, S) ↦ S` separates `A` from `B`, satisfies the
graphoid axioms; that is the reason this file's API is shaped like `IsSemigraphoid`'s
(`Lauritzen §2.1.1` / `Lauritzen Ex. 3.2` in tags).

**Proof formalization notes.** *Book vs Lean, three deliberate differences.*

1. **Walks, not paths.** Lauritzen quantifies over *paths*. On a `SimpleGraph` the two
   quantifications define the same relation: a walk contains a path with the same endpoints
   and a smaller support (`SimpleGraph.Walk.bypass`, `Walk.bypass_isPath`,
   `Walk.support_bypass_subset`), and a path is a walk. `separates_iff_forall_path` records
   this equivalence. We take walks as primitive because `SimpleGraph.Walk` is the type
   carrying the induction principle and the `support` / `takeUntil` / `induce` API that every
   proof here runs on; `SimpleGraph.Path` is a subtype of it.
2. **`S` may meet `A` or `B`.** No disjointness is assumed in the definition. If `a ∈ A ∩ S`
   then every walk out of `a` already meets `S` at its own start, so `Separates` holds
   vacuously in that direction — that is `separates_self_left`. The book's blocks are
   disjoint; the disjointness is carried by the *consumers*
   (`GraphicalModels.IsGlobalMarkov`), never by this definition, so that the monotonicity
   lemmas below need no side conditions.
3. **Finsets, not sets.** `S A B : Finset V`, matching the index-block vocabulary of
   `IsSemigraphoid` and `CondIndepCoords`. The separated vertices themselves range over all of
   `V`; nothing here needs `V` finite or `G` locally finite.

The two Mathlib bridges are stated with **no** disjointness or non-membership side conditions
and are genuinely unconditional: if `a ∈ S` then no element of the deleted-vertex subtype lies
over `a`, so the right-hand sides quantify vacuously exactly where `Separates` is vacuous.
The intended proof of both is `SimpleGraph.Walk.induce` (lift a walk avoiding `S` to the
induced subgraph on `Sᶜ`) in one direction and `Walk.map` along the induced embedding in the
other.

**Bibliographic comments.** Separation of vertex sets is classical graph theory (Menger 1927);
its use as the combinatorial carrier of conditional independence is due to the
Markov-field literature — J. M. Hammersley and P. Clifford's unpublished 1971 manuscript,
and in the form used here Lauritzen's book, which credits the graphoid reading to J. Pearl,
*Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems*, Morgan Kaufmann, 1988. Mathlib has no
separator vocabulary of its own in this pin (`grep -rn "separator" Mathlib/Combinatorics/`
returns nothing), so `Separates` is new; everything below it — walks, supports, vertex
deletion, components of a complement — is Mathlib's.

*Edge behaviour.* Vacuously true when `A = ∅` or `B = ∅` (`separates_empty_left`,

when `A` and `S` overlap, which the book excludes by fiat. No disjointness of `A`, `B`, `S`

two agree: a path is a walk, and every walk contains a path with the same endpoints whose
support is contained in the walk's (`SimpleGraph.Walk.bypass`,
`SimpleGraph.Walk.support_bypass_subset`). -/

/-- **Bridge to Mathlib's vertex deletion.** `S` separates `A` from `B` exactly when no
vertex of `A` is reachable from a vertex of `B` in `G` with the vertices of `S` removed.

The subtype `((⊤ : G.Subgraph).deleteVerts S).verts` is `Set.univ \ S` by
`Subgraph.deleteVerts_verts` (`rfl`), so quantifying over it *is* quantifying over the
vertices outside `S`; vertices of `A ∩ S` are excluded on the right-hand side and vacuous on
the left (`separates_self_left`), which is why no disjointness hypothesis appears.

This is the hinge into Mathlib's connectivity API. Proof route: `SimpleGraph.Walk.induce`
lifts an `S`-avoiding walk to the induced subgraph, and `SimpleGraph.Walk.map` along the
induced embedding pushes it back. -/

/-- **Bridge to `SimpleGraph.ComponentCompl`.** Separation says that no vertex of `A` and no
vertex of `B` lie in a common connected component of the complement of `S`. Stated with
`SimpleGraph.componentComplMk`, whose hypothesis `a ∉ (S : Set V)` supplies the
outside-the-separator side condition, so again nothing is assumed about `A ∩ S`.

`SimpleGraph.ConnectedComponent.eq`; kept separate because `ComponentCompl` is the form the
`Ends` API and any future decomposable-graph lane consume. -/
