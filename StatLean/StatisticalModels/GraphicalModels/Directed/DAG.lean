# Directed acyclic graphs — parents, ancestors, ancestral sets, topological order

The directed side of the graphical-model vocabulary: Lauritzen's `pa`, `ch`, `an`, `de`, `nd`,
his *ancestral sets* and the ancestral closure `An(·)`, the induced sub-DAG `G_A`, and the
existence of a topological (linear) extension in which every parent precedes its child.

* `IsAcyclicRel r` — no vertex reaches itself along a nonempty directed chain, stated with
  `Relation.TransGen`; `IsAcyclicRel.mono` — a sub-relation of an acyclic relation is acyclic;
* `DAG V` — the bundled carrier: an edge relation together with its acyclicity;
  `DAG.irrefl`, `DAG.ne_of_adj` — irreflexivity, **derived** rather than assumed;
* `DAG.reflTransGen_antisymm`, `DAG.isPartialOrder_reflTransGen` — reachability
  `Relation.ReflTransGen D.Adj` is a partial order, the fact that carries the topological order;
* `DAG.parents`, `DAG.children`, `DAG.ancestors`, `DAG.descendants`, `DAG.nonDescendants` —
  the five neighbourhoods as `Finset`s, with their membership characterisations;
* `DAG.parents_subset_nonDescendants`, `DAG.notMem_ancestors_self`,
  `DAG.disjoint_singleton_nonDescendants` — the sanity lemmas the directed local Markov
  property will consume (`v ⫫ nd(v) ∖ pa(v) ∣ pa(v)` needs exactly these disjointnesses);
* `DAG.IsAncestralSet`, `DAG.ancestralClosure` — closure under parents, and the smallest
  ancestral set containing a given block, with monotonicity, extensivity, idempotence, and
  minimality;
* `DAG.exists_linearOrder_extending`, `DAG.exists_topologicalOrder` — a linear extension of
  reachability, and (on a finite vertex set) an enumeration `V ≃ Fin (card V)` in which every
  ancestor precedes its descendant;
* `DAG.induce` — the sub-DAG induced on a vertex block `A`, together with
  `DAG.parents_induce_of_isAncestralSet`: on an **ancestral** set the induced parent sets are
  unchanged. This is the construction Lauritzen's Corollary 3.23 restricts to before
  moralizing, and it lives here (rather than in `Directed/Moralization.lean`) because it is a
  DAG-to-DAG operation; `Moralization.lean` only post-composes it with `moralGraph`.

**Why a bare relation and not `Digraph`.** Mathlib's `Digraph` in this pin
(`Combinatorics/Digraph/Basic.lean`, 233 lines) is a bare
`structure Digraph (V) where Adj : V → V → Prop` carrying **only** lattice algebra — `⊔`, `⊓`,
`ᶜ`, `\`, `sSup`, `sInf`, the `CompleteAtomicBooleanAlgebra` instance, and adjacency-decidability
instances. It has **no** walks, no reachability, no acyclicity, no ancestors: `grep -rn
"Walk\|Reachable\|Path" Mathlib/Combinatorics/Digraph/` returns nothing, and the only other file
in that directory (`Orientation.lean`, 92 lines) merely converts a `Digraph` to a `SimpleGraph`
by forgetting orientations (`Digraph.toSimpleGraphInclusive = SimpleGraph.fromRel G.Adj`).
`Relation.ReflTransGen` / `Relation.TransGen` (`Logic/Relation.lean`), by contrast, come with a
full library — `trans`, `head`, `tail`, `single`, `mono`, `lift`, `head_induction_on`,
`trans_induction_on`, `cases_head`, `reflTransGen_iff_eq_or_transGen` — which is exactly the
induction principle every proof below runs on. We therefore build the directed theory on a bare
`Adj : V → V → Prop` plus `Relation.(Refl)TransGen`, and record here that this was checked
against the pin rather than assumed. (Nothing is lost: `Digraph` adds no content over its `Adj`
field, so a `Digraph`-phrased development would have to build the same closure API anyway.)

**Reference.** S. L. Lauritzen, *Graphical Models*, Oxford Statistical Science Series 17,
Clarendon Press, Oxford, **1996**, §2.1.1, pp. 5–7. Every notion in this file is an
**unnumbered** definition of that section — there is no "Definition 2.x" to cite. In the book's
notation: `pa(α)` the parents, `ch(α)` the children, `an(β)` the ancestors (`α` leads to `β`
along a directed path), `de(α)` the descendants, `nd(α) = V ∖ (de(α) ∪ {α})` the
non-descendants; a subset is *ancestral* when it contains the parents of each of its elements,
and `An(A)` is the smallest ancestral set containing `A`. `G_A` denotes the subgraph induced on
`A` (`Lauritzen §2.1.1` in tags).

**Proof formalization notes.** *Book vs Lean, six deliberate differences.*

1. **`an(β)` excludes `β`, `An(A)` includes `A` — and we follow the book exactly.** Lauritzen's
   `an(β)` is the set of vertices from which `β` is reachable along a **nonempty** directed
   path, so `β ∉ an(β)`; correspondingly `DAG.ancestors` is cut out by `Relation.TransGen`, not
   `Relation.ReflTransGen`, and `DAG.notMem_ancestors_self` records that this is automatic in a
   DAG. `An(A)`, being the smallest ancestral set *containing* `A`, does contain `A`; so
   `DAG.ancestralClosure A = A ∪ ⋃_{v ∈ A} an(v)` and `DAG.subset_ancestralClosure` is a
   theorem. The same asymmetry governs `de` versus `nd`: `nd(α)` removes `α` explicitly because
   `de(α)` does not contain it.
2. **Irreflexivity is derived, not a field.** Lauritzen's directed graphs have no loops. A loop
   `α → α` is a directed cycle, so acyclicity already forbids it (`DAG.irrefl`, via
   `Relation.TransGen.single`); a separate `loopless` field would be redundant, and by the
   constitutive-versus-regularity test a redundant field does not belong in the structure. This
   is the one place where we deviate from `SimpleGraph`'s shape, which *does* carry `loopless`
   because there is no stronger field to derive it from.
3. **Structure *and* predicate.** `IsAcyclicRel` is the predicate on a bare relation; `DAG` is
   the bundled carrier. Both are wanted: the bundle gives dot notation and lets `moralGraph`
   and `DAG.induce` be honest functions `DAG V → _`, matching the `SimpleGraph`-shaped
   vocabulary the round-1 undirected layer already speaks; the predicate lets us say
   "this sub-relation is still acyclic" (`IsAcyclicRel.mono`) without building a structure.
4. **The neighbourhoods are `Finset`s, and their decidability is explicit.** `Finset V` is the
   index-block vocabulary of `Core.Separation`, `Core.Semigraphoid` and `Core.Coordinates`, so
   the directed neighbourhoods must be `Finset`s to be consumable there. That forces
   `[Fintype V]` plus a `Decidable` instance for the predicate being filtered:
   `[DecidableRel D.Adj]` for `parents`/`children`, and
   `[DecidableRel (Relation.TransGen D.Adj)]` for `ancestors`/`descendants`/`nonDescendants`/
   `ancestralClosure`. **The pin has no instance for the latter** — its only reachability
   instance is `DecidableRel G.Reachable` for a `SimpleGraph`
   (`Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Connectivity/Finite.lean:56`), and deciding `Relation.TransGen`
   is a genuine transitive-closure computation that is out of scope here. So we take it as an
   instance **argument** rather than hiding it behind `Classical.dec`: every consumer can
   discharge it with `classical`, and any two choices give equal `Finset`s by
   `Finset.filter_congr_decidable`.
5. **`DAG.induce A` keeps the vertex type `V`** and merely restricts the edge relation to `A`,
   leaving vertices outside `A` isolated, rather than moving to the subtype `↥A`. Lauritzen's
   `G_A` is the subgraph on the vertex set `A`; the two agree on everything we ask of them,
   because every edge of `DAG.induce A` has both endpoints in `A`, so every directed chain and
   (after moralization) every walk between vertices of `A` stays inside `A`. Keeping `V` fixed
   is what lets the round-1 `Separates`/`IsGlobalMarkov` vocabulary, which is phrased on
   `Finset V` for a single `V`, apply verbatim to the moralized restriction — the alternative
   would drag a subtype transport through every statement of Corollary 3.23.
6. **The topological order is stated as an existence theorem, not a sort.** Mathlib's
   `extend_partialOrder` (`Order/Extension/Linear.lean`, the Szpilrajn extension theorem) turns
   the partial order `Relation.ReflTransGen D.Adj` into a linear one, and on a finite type
   `monoEquivOfFin` (`Data/Fintype/Sort.lean:29`) converts a linear order into an enumeration
   by `Fin (Fintype.card V)`. We consume both rather than writing a topological sort: per the
   reuse ledger, a hand-rolled sort would re-derive Szpilrajn.

**Bibliographic comments.** Directed graphical models and their ancestral vocabulary are due to
the recursive-model literature — T. Speed and H. Kiiveri, "Gaussian Markov distributions over
finite graphs," *Ann. Statist.* **14** (1986), 138–150; S. L. Lauritzen and D. J. Spiegelhalter,
"Local computations with probabilities on graphical structures," *J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B*
**50** (1988), 157–224; and J. Pearl, *Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems*, Morgan
Kaufmann, 1988. The linear-extension theorem consumed in `DAG.exists_linearOrder_extending` is
E. Szpilrajn, "Sur l'extension de l'ordre partiel," *Fund. Math.* **16** (1930), 386–389, which
Mathlib proves via Zorn's lemma. Mathlib has no DAG vocabulary of its own beyond the bare
`Digraph` adjacency lattice discussed above, so everything in this file is new here, while every
closure-theoretic ingredient (`Relation.TransGen`, `Relation.ReflTransGen`, `extend_partialOrder`,
`monoEquivOfFin`) is Mathlib's.

`u` is a *parent* of `v`.

*Edge behaviour.* Irreflexivity is **not** a field: it follows from `acyclic` (`DAG.irrefl`), so

book's characterisation as `DAG.isAncestralSet_ancestralClosure` (it *is* ancestral) together
with `DAG.ancestralClosure_subset_of_isAncestralSet` (it is contained in every ancestral
superset of `A`). *Edge behaviour.* `An(∅) = ∅`, and `An(A) = A` exactly when `A` is ancestral

/-! ### Topological order

Lauritzen uses a *well-ordering* of the vertices compatible with the edges throughout the
recursive-factorization theory (§3.2.2, p. 46): the recursive factorization `(DF)` is stated
relative to an ordering in which the parents of a vertex precede it. On a finite vertex set the
two statements below supply such an ordering. -/

/-- **Szpilrajn for a DAG**: reachability extends to a linear order, so every ancestor precedes
its descendants. Consumes Mathlib's `extend_partialOrder` (`Order/Extension/Linear.lean`)
applied to the partial order `DAG.isPartialOrder_reflTransGen`; no sort is written by hand. -/
theorem exists_linearOrder_extending (D : DAG V) :
    ∃ s : V → V → Prop, IsLinearOrder V s ∧
      ∀ ⦃u v : V⦄, Relation.ReflTransGen D.Adj u v → s u v := by

  obtain ⟨s, hs, hle⟩ := extend_partialOrder (Relation.ReflTransGen D.Adj)
  exact ⟨s, hs, fun _ _ h => hle _ _ h⟩

/-- **Topological order on a finite vertex set**: an enumeration of `V` by
`Fin (Fintype.card V)` in which every ancestor precedes its descendant — in particular every
parent precedes its child (take `Relation.TransGen.single`). Route: the linear order of
`DAG.exists_linearOrder_extending`, made into a `LinearOrder V` instance (its decidability
supplied classically), then `monoEquivOfFin` (`Data/Fintype/Sort.lean:29`).

*Edge behaviour.* On the empty vertex type the equivalence is the empty one and the statement is
vacuous. -/

/-! ### The induced sub-DAG

Lauritzen's `G_A` (§2.1.1, p. 7). See the module docstring, note 5, for why the vertex type is
kept fixed. This construction lives here rather than in `Directed/Moralization.lean` because it
is a DAG-to-DAG operation; moralization merely post-composes it. -/

/-- The **sub-DAG induced on `A`** (Lauritzen `G_A`, §2.1.1, p. 7): keep exactly the edges with
both endpoints in `A`.

*Book vs Lean.* The vertex type stays `V`; vertices outside `A` survive as isolated points
rather than being deleted. Every edge of `D.induce A` has both endpoints in `A`
(`DAG.mem_of_induce_adj`), so the isolated points take part in no directed chain and, after
moralization, in no walk — which is why this presentation proves the same theorems as the book's
vertex-deleting `G_A` while keeping the round-1 `Finset V`-indexed vocabulary applicable.
Acyclicity is inherited by `IsAcyclicRel.mono`. *Edge behaviour.* `D.induce Finset.univ = D`
(`DAG.induce_univ`) and `D.induce ∅` is the empty graph. -/

/-- Edge-decidability is inherited by the induced sub-DAG (`Finset` membership is decidable), so

restrict a recursive factorization to `An(A ∪ B ∪ S)` without changing any of the conditional
distributions, and hence why d-separation may be read off the moral graph of the induced
sub-DAG. -/
