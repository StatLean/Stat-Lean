# d-separation — Pearl's criterion, and its equivalence with moral-graph separation

Lauritzen's *chain* criterion for reading conditional independence off a directed acyclic
graph (p. 48, an **unnumbered** definition), together with the theorem that makes the whole
undirected layer of this area available to the directed theory: d-separation in `G` is
*exactly* separation in the moral graph of the smallest ancestral set containing the three
blocks (**Proposition 3.25**, p. 48).

* `ArrowDir`, `IsCollider` — the orientation vocabulary. `ArrowDir` records how one arrow of a
  chain sits relative to a vertex it is incident to (`into` / `outOf`); `Option ArrowDir` adds
  `none` for "there is no arrow on that side", which happens exactly at the two ends of the
  chain. `IsCollider din dout` is Lauritzen's "arrows of the chain **meet head-to-head**": both
  incident arrows point into the vertex. Endpoints are never colliders
  (`not_isCollider_none_left`, `not_isCollider_none_right`);
* `Chain` — a chain from `u` to `w`: a sequence of vertices in which consecutive vertices are
  joined by an arrow **in either direction**, the direction of each step being recorded by the
  constructor used (`fwd` / `bwd`). See *"Book vs Lean"* note 1 below for why this rather than
  a walk in the underlying undirected graph. `Chain.support`, `Chain.reverse` mirror
  `SimpleGraph.Walk`;
* `NoDescendantIn`, `BlocksAt` — the two clauses of Lauritzen's blocking rule at a single
  vertex occurrence: a **non-collider** blocks when it lies in `S`; a **collider** blocks when
  neither it nor any of its descendants lies in `S`;
* `Chain.BlockedFrom`, `Chain.Blocked`, `Chain.Active` — blocking of a whole chain, defined by
  structural recursion that carries the direction of the incoming arrow along;
* `DSeparated r S A B` — every chain from a vertex of `A` to a vertex of `B` is blocked by `S`;
* `dSeparated_symm`, `dSeparated_mono_left` / `_right`, `dSeparated_empty_left` / `_right`,
  `dSeparated_self_left` / `_right` — the API mirroring `Core.Separation`. **There is no
  monotonicity in the separator**: enlarging `S` can *unblock* a collider, and
  `not_forall_dSeparated_of_subset_sep` is the machine-checkable refutation, witnessed by the
  three-vertex collider `0 → 2 ← 1`. This is the one structural difference between
  d-separation and `Separates`;
* the graph `(G_{An(A ∪ B ∪ S)})^m` in which Proposition 3.25 reads is
  `Markov.ancestralMoralGraph`;
* `dSeparated_iff_separates_moralGraph_ancestralClosure` — **Proposition 3.25**, the headline:
  for disjoint `A`, `B`, `S` in a DAG, `S` d-separates `A` from `B` **iff** `S` separates `A`
  from `B` in `(G_{An(A ∪ B ∪ S)})^m`;
* `dSeparated_iff_forall_nodup` — the book's own phrasing, over chains with *distinct* vertices
  (see note 1); **not** a corollary of Proposition 3.25 — proved by shortening a chain of
  minimal length, over `Chain.exists_shorter_of_not_nodup` and `Chain.forward_run`;
* `condIndep_of_dSeparated` — the consequence: under the **directed global Markov property**,
  d-separation implies conditional independence. Cited as **Proposition 3.25 + Corollary
  3.23**; see the reference block for why there is no single theorem number for it.

**Reference.** S. L. Lauritzen, *Graphical Models*, Oxford Statistical Science Series 17,
Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1996:

* *chain*: §2.1.1, p. 6, **unnumbered** — "a chain of length `n` from `α` to `β` is a sequence
  `α = α₀, …, αₙ = β` of distinct vertices such that `αᵢ₋₁ → αᵢ` or `αᵢ → αᵢ₋₁` for all `i`";
* *blocked / active / d-separated*: §3.2.2, p. 48, **unnumbered**, credited to Pearl (1986) with
  the formal treatment in Verma and Pearl (1990) — "a chain `π` from `a` to `b` is said to be
  blocked by `S` if it contains a vertex `γ ∈ π` such that either `γ ∈ S` and arrows of `π` do
  not meet head-to-head at `γ`, or `γ ∉ S` nor has `γ` any descendants in `S`, and arrows of `π`
  do meet head-to-head at `γ`. A chain that is not blocked by `S` is said to be active. Two
  subsets `A` and `B` are now said to be d-separated by `S` if all chains from `A` to `B` are
  blocked by `S`";
* **Proposition 3.25**, p. 48 — for **disjoint** `A`, `B`, `S`, `S` d-separates `A` from `B` iff
  `S` separates `A` from `B` in `(G_{An(A∪B∪S)})^m`;
* **Corollary 3.23**, p. 47 — the conditional independence `A ⫫ B ∣ S` holds whenever `A` and
  `B` are separated by `S` in `(G_{An(A∪B∪S)})^m`; "the property in Corollary 3.23 will be
  referred to as the **directed global Markov property (DG)**".

⚠️ **There is no single numbered theorem "d-separation ⟺ directed global Markov".** The book
gives (DG) a *moral-graph* definition (Cor. 3.23) and then proves separately that d-separation
is equivalent to it (Prop. 3.25). `condIndep_of_dSeparated` is therefore tagged with **both**
numbers, and its proof is literally "Prop. 3.25, then (DG)". Citing it as one theorem would
misattribute (`Lauritzen §3.2.2` in tags).

**Proof formalization notes.** *Book vs Lean, four deliberate differences.*

1. **Chains are oriented walks; the book's chains have distinct vertices.** Lauritzen's chain
   (p. 6) is a sequence of *distinct* vertices. `Chain` drops the distinctness, exactly as
   `Core.Separation.Separates` is phrased over `SimpleGraph.Walk` rather than
   `SimpleGraph.Path`: `Chain` is the type carrying the induction principle that
   `Chain.BlockedFrom` and every proof below run on, and adding a `Nodup` side condition to the
   *definition* would make the recursion carry a proof obligation it does not need. The two
   readings of d-separation agree — `dSeparated_iff_forall_nodup` — but, unlike in the
   undirected case, this is **not** `Walk.bypass`: shortening a chain can turn a non-collider
   into a **collider**, and a collider is exactly what blocks when nothing below it lies in `S`.
   ⚠️ The equivalence is also **not** a corollary of Proposition 3.25: that proposition is
   proved here only for the walk reading, and the chain its proof builds out of a moral walk
   need not have distinct vertices. It is proved directly instead, by shortening a chain of
   **minimal length**: `Chain.exists_shorter_of_not_nodup` shows the merged occurrence cannot
   block, the one dangerous configuration being ruled out by acyclicity (`Chain.forward_run`).
   Consequently the proof uses only the DAG hypothesis, **not** the disjointness of the three
   blocks, which the statement nevertheless carries.
2. **Orientation is data, not a proposition.** The direction of each step is recorded by the
   constructor used (`fwd`/`bwd`), so "arrows meet head-to-head at `γ`" is a *structural*
   condition of the recursion rather than a proposition recovered by case analysis on which of
   `r u v`, `r v u` holds. It needs no decidability of `r` and no acyclicity — so the vocabulary
   is available for an arbitrary relation, and the DAG hypotheses appear only where they are
   genuinely used (Proposition 3.25 and below). The moral graph is *not* the underlying
   undirected graph anyway (it has extra marriage edges), so the two sides of Proposition 3.25
   are walks in different graphs.
3. **Blocking is evaluated at vertex *occurrences*.** Lauritzen writes "it contains a vertex
   `γ ∈ π`"; a chain that repeats a vertex meets it with different pairs of incident arrows
   each time, and the same vertex may be a collider at one occurrence and not at another. The
   recursion visits occurrences, which is the reading the book's proof uses.
4. **The blocking rule is stated over a bare relation, and `S`-monotonicity is refuted rather
   than proved.** `Chain`, `BlocksAt`, `Blocked` and `DSeparated` take `r : V → V → Prop`;
   a DAG-level consumer writes `DSeparated D.Adj S A B`. Nothing in these definitions uses
   acyclicity. Compared with `Separates`, exactly one API lemma is missing and cannot be added:
   `separates_of_subset_sep` has **no** d-separation analogue, because conditioning on a
   collider opens the chain through it. `not_forall_dSeparated_of_subset_sep` records this.

**Bibliographic comments.** The criterion is J. Pearl's, "Fusion, propagation, and structuring
in belief networks", *Artificial Intelligence* **29** (1986), 241–288, with the full formal
treatment in T. Verma and J. Pearl, "Causal networks: semantics and expressiveness", in
*Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence 4*, North-Holland, 1990, 69–76; Lauritzen presents it
as "an alternative formulation of the directed global Markov property" (p. 48). Lauritzen's
remark following Proposition 3.25 (p. 50, equation **(3.22)**) records that **the criterion
cannot be improved**: D. Geiger and J. Pearl, "On the logic of causal models", in *Uncertainty
in Artificial Intelligence 4*, North-Holland, 1990, show in their Theorem 5 that for any
directed acyclic graph `G` one can choose state spaces and a probability `P` for which
`A ⫫ B ∣ S ⟺ S` d-separates `A` from `B` — so no strictly finer graphical rule reads more
conditional independences out of the graph than d-separation does. That is a statement about
the *existence of a law*, quantified over state spaces, and is recorded here as a remark only:
it is far outside this file's scope and is deliberately **not** stated in Lean.

/-- The direction of one arrow of a chain, **read from a vertex it is incident to**: `into` if
the arrow points at that vertex, `outOf` if it points away from it.

*Edge behaviour.* The two ends of a chain have an arrow on one side only; the missing side is
represented by `none : Option ArrowDir` rather than by a third constructor, so that
`IsCollider` can be stated uniformly at every vertex occurrence of a chain, endpoints
included. -/

*Edge behaviour.* At an end of the chain one of the two is `none`, so `IsCollider` is false

occurrences can be colliders, which is what Lauritzen's phrase "arrows of `π` meet head-to-head

/-- A **chain** from `u` to `w` for the relation `r`: a sequence of vertices in which
consecutive vertices are joined by an arrow, traversed in either direction, **together with the
direction of each step**. `fwd h c` prepends a step `u → v` (so `h : r u v`) and `bwd h c`
prepends a step `u ← v` (so `h : r v u`), in both cases continuing along `c` from `v`.

This is Lauritzen's chain (§2.1.1, p. 6) *without* the requirement that the vertices be
distinct — i.e. an oriented walk. See the module docstring, note 1, for why, and
`dSeparated_iff_forall_nodup` for the book's phrasing. Modelled on `SimpleGraph.Walk`, whose
`support` / `reverse` API is mirrored below.

*Edge behaviour.* `Chain.nil v : Chain r v v` is the chain of length `0`; it has one vertex, no
arrows, and is blocked by `S` exactly when `v ∈ S`. Nothing here assumes `r` irreflexive or
acyclic: a self-loop `r v v` yields chains, and `Chain` is well-defined for any relation. -/

/-! ### Blocking -/

/-- `γ` has **no descendant in `S`**, counting `γ` itself among its own descendants.

This is the second clause of Lauritzen's blocking rule (p. 48), "`γ ∉ S` nor has `γ` any
descendants in `S`", read as the single condition `De(γ) ∩ S = ∅` with
`De(γ) = {γ} ∪ de(γ)`: Lauritzen's `de(γ)` (§2.1.1, p. 6) excludes `γ`, and the reflexivity of
`Relation.ReflTransGen` puts it back, which is exactly the conjunction the book states.

*Book vs Lean.* Stated with `Relation.ReflTransGen` on a bare relation rather than with
`Directed.DAG.descendants`, so that `BlocksAt` is available before any DAG structure is fixed;
for `r = D.Adj` the two agree by unfolding `descendants`. *Edge behaviour.* Vacuously true for
`S = ∅`, so over an empty separator a chain is blocked exactly when it has a collider. -/
def NoDescendantIn (r : V → V → Prop) (S : Finset V) (γ : V) : Prop :=
  ∀ d : V, Relation.ReflTransGen r γ d → d ∉ S

/-- **Lauritzen's blocking rule at one vertex occurrence** (p. 48, unnumbered). The vertex `γ`
of a chain, met with incident arrow directions `din` (near side) and `dout` (far side), blocks
the chain relative to `S` when either

* the arrows do **not** meet head-to-head at `γ` and `γ ∈ S`, or
* they **do** meet head-to-head at `γ` and neither `γ` nor any descendant of `γ` is in `S`.

*Edge behaviour.* At an end of the chain (`din = none` or `dout = none`) the vertex is never a
collider, so the rule reduces to `γ ∈ S`; in particular a chain that starts or ends inside `S`
is blocked, which is what makes `dSeparated_self_left` / `_right` true and mirrors
`separates_self_left` / `_right`. The two clauses are mutually exclusive and exhaust the cases,
so `BlocksAt` is the negation of "`γ` leaves the chain open at this occurrence". -/

Structural recursion on the chain: at each vertex the recursion knows the direction of the
arrow behind it (`din`, the accumulator) and reads the direction of the arrow ahead of it off
the constructor — `fwd` means the next arrow points *out of* the current vertex and *into* the
next one, `bwd` the other way round. The chain is blocked when *some* occurrence blocks
(`BlocksAt`), which is Lauritzen's "it contains a vertex `γ ∈ π` such that …".

*Edge behaviour.* On `nil` the far side is `none`, so the last vertex blocks exactly when it

/-- **Blocking does not depend on the direction of traversal.** Reversing a chain exchanges the
near and far side at every vertex occurrence, and `IsCollider` is symmetric
(`isCollider_comm`), so the set of blocking occurrences is unchanged. This is what makes
d-separation symmetric in `A` and `B`, and it is the directed counterpart of
`Walk.support_reverse` in `separates_symm`.

The intended proof generalises over the accumulator: `BlockedFrom S din (p.reverseAux q)` is
`BlockedFrom` of `p` and of `q` glued at their common endpoint, with the two accumulators
exchanged. -/

/-! #### Chains along a line of descent

The two constructions Proposition 3.25 reroutes through. Both are stated as *existence*
statements rather than as functions `Relation.ReflTransGen D.Adj x t → Chain D.Adj x t`, because
`Relation.ReflTransGen` is `Prop`-valued and `Chain` is `Type`-valued: a directed path is not
data here, so no chain can be *computed* from one. Every consumer below only ever needs the
chain to exist, so nothing is lost. -/

/-- **The accumulator matters only through `IsCollider`.** Two accumulators that both fail to
make the first vertex of a chain a collider give the same blocking: at a non-collider the rule is
membership of the separator, which does not mention the arrows at all. -/

does not. The accumulator is arbitrary: the first vertex is a non-collider whatever sits behind

/-! #### Shortening a chain that repeats a vertex

The machinery of `dSeparated_iff_forall_nodup`. The book's chains have *distinct* vertices;
`Chain` does not (module docstring, note 1), and the two readings of d-separation are reconciled
here directly, not by a corollary of Proposition 3.25 — see `dSeparated_iff_forall_nodup` for
why that route does not close. -/

/-- **The accumulator matters only through the blocking of the first vertex.** Strengthens
`blockedFrom_congr_din`: it is enough that neither accumulator makes the *first occurrence*
block, whether or not it is a collider. -/

/-- **A chain entered along an arrow, out of a vertex with no descendant in `S`, runs forward
all the way.** Under `din = into`, a `bwd` step would make the first vertex a collider and — the
descendant clause being satisfied — block; so an unblocked chain can only take `fwd` steps, and
every vertex it visits is a descendant of its first one.

This is the observation that makes the shortening argument below work, and it is where
acyclicity enters `dSeparated_iff_forall_nodup`: a chain that comes back to its own starting
vertex under these conditions would close a directed cycle. -/

/-- **An unblocked chain that repeats a vertex can be shortened without becoming blocked.**

Deleting the stretch between two occurrences of `x` changes the blocking rule *only at `x`*,
whose two incident arrows are now the near one of the first occurrence and the far one of the
second. The surviving occurrence can therefore be a collider where neither of the original ones
was, which is exactly why `SimpleGraph.Walk.bypass` has no analogue here. It does not block all
the same:

* if the chain leaves `x` **along** an arrow at the first occurrence (`fwd`), then `x` cannot
  have all its descendants outside `S`: `Chain.forward_run` would make the second occurrence of
  `x` a descendant of `x`, i.e. a directed cycle. So the collider clause is satisfied;
* if it leaves `x` **against** an arrow (`bwd`) and the first occurrence is a collider, activity
  there already supplies a descendant in `S`; and if it is not a collider, neither is the merged
  occurrence, and `x ∉ S`. -/

/-! ### d-separation -/

chain from a vertex of `A` to a vertex of `B` is blocked by `S`.

*Book vs Lean.* Stated for a bare relation `r : V → V → Prop`; a consumer holding a
`D : DAG V` writes `DSeparated D.Adj S A B`. Nothing in the definition uses acyclicity — it is
needed only from `dSeparated_iff_separates_moralGraph_ancestralClosure` onwards — and stating
it here would make every basic lemma below carry a hypothesis it does not use. The argument
order `S A B` matches `Core.Separation.Separates`.

*Edge behaviour.* Vacuously true when `A = ∅` or `B = ∅` (`dSeparated_empty_left`,
`dSeparated_empty_right`), and automatically true when `A ⊆ S` or `B ⊆ S`
(`dSeparated_self_left`, `dSeparated_self_right`) since an endpoint of a chain is never a
collider. No disjointness of `A`, `B`, `S` is assumed, exactly as in `Separates`; Lauritzen's
disjointness is carried by the consumers that need it (Proposition 3.25 below). Unlike
`Separates`, this is **not** monotone in `S`: see `not_forall_dSeparated_of_subset_sep`. -/

/-! ### The separator is not monotone — refutation

`Core.Separation.separates_of_subset_sep` says that growing the separator preserves undirected
separation. **The d-separation analogue is false**, and this section refutes it rather than
leaving a plausible-looking lemma unstated. The obstruction is the second clause of the
blocking rule: a collider blocks only while neither it nor any of its descendants lies in `S`,
so putting the collider *into* `S` opens the chain. This is the whole point of Pearl's
criterion — "explaining away" — and it is why `IsDirectedGlobalMarkov` cannot be obtained from
the undirected global Markov property of any single fixed graph. -/

/-- The three-vertex collider `0 → 2 ← 1` on `Fin 3`, as a bare relation. It is acyclic (every
arrow ends at `2`, which has no outgoing arrow) and loopless, so it is the adjacency relation of
a genuine directed acyclic graph; it is used only to refute monotonicity of d-separation in the
separator. -/

/-- **Contracting the colliders of an active chain into marriage edges** — the construction
behind the first half of Proposition 3.25, and the only place where "every vertex of an active
chain lies in `An(A ∪ B ∪ S)`" is proved.

Both statements are made in one structural recursion on the chain, because they need each other:
the walk is built out of the non-collider occurrences, which must be shown to lie in `T` before
they can carry a moral edge, and a non-collider's membership of `T` is read off the *rest* of the
chain, not off the part already traversed. The three conclusions are, in order:

* `x ∈ T`. At a collider this is Lauritzen's "activity forces a descendant in `S`", i.e.
  `x ∈ An(S)`; at a vertex whose arrow ahead points away it follows from the next vertex by
  ancestrality; at the last vertex it is `y ∈ B ⊆ T`. The one case it cannot supply — the arrow
  behind points away *and* the arrow ahead points in — is exactly the hypothesis `hTx`, which the
  caller discharges (in the recursion, from `x ∈ T` by ancestrality; at the top level, from
  `a ∈ A ⊆ T`).
* At a **collider** occurrence the walk cannot pass through `x`, so the conclusion names the next
  vertex `z` of the chain instead: it is a second parent of `x`, and the two parents are the two
  ends of the marriage edge the caller installs.
* At a **non-collider** occurrence `x` is on the walk, and is outside `S` because the chain is
  active there.

The graph is abstracted to any `M` with the adjacency of `(𝒢_T)^m` (`DAG.moralGraph_induce_adj`),
so that this recursion is stated once and instantiated at `T = An(A ∪ B ∪ S)`. -/

/-- **Turning a moral walk that circumvents `S` into an active chain** — the construction behind
the second half of Proposition 3.25.

The recursion walks along `w` and assembles the chain, replacing each **marriage** edge by the
two arrows into its witness `γ`. Every witness is a collider, and so are the vertices of `w` that
two arrows of `w` point into; such a collider *blocks* exactly when neither it nor a descendant
of it lies in `S`, and that is the case the book reroutes. The reroute uses the minimality of the
ancestral set: a blocking collider `γ` lies in `T` and has no descendant in `S`, so it must reach
a vertex `t` of `A ∪ B`, along a line of descent that avoids `S`
(`Chain.exists_chain_of_reflTransGen`, `Chain.exists_chain_prepend_of_reflTransGen`). Which
half of the walk survives depends on which block `t` lands in, and that is why the conclusion
is a **disjunction**:

* the first disjunct hands the caller a chain out of `x` that is unblocked *for every*
  accumulator, so that the caller may prepend its own arrow to it whichever way that arrow points
  — this is the `t ∈ B` reroute, which keeps the walk's prefix and discards its suffix;
* the second disjunct is a finished answer: the `t ∈ A` reroute keeps the walk's **suffix** and
  discards the prefix, so it produces a complete active chain from `A` to `B` and the recursion
  simply propagates it outwards.

Having both disjuncts is what removes the need for an outer induction on the number of blocking
colliders: each reroute is taken at the first collider that blocks, and it finishes one of the
two disjuncts outright. -/

/-- **Lauritzen Proposition 3.25** (p. 48) — *the headline of this file*. For **disjoint**
blocks `A`, `B`, `S` of a directed acyclic graph `D`, the separator `S` d-separates `A` from `B`
**iff** `S` separates `A` from `B` in `(G_{An(A∪B∪S)})^m`.

This is the bridge that lets the undirected separation theory serve the directed one: the
left-hand side is Pearl's local, chain-by-chain criterion, the right-hand side is a single
application of `Separates` to one explicitly constructed undirected graph.

*Edge behaviour.* `ancestralClosure ∅ = ∅` and moralization of the empty sub-DAG is the empty
graph, so at `A = B = S = ∅` the graph is `⊥` and `Separates ⊥ ∅ ∅ ∅` holds vacuously, matching
`dSeparated_empty_left`. The vertex type stays `V`: the induced sub-DAG keeps `V` and merely
deletes arrows leaving the ancestral set, so `Separates` and `DSeparated` speak about the same
blocks with no subtype transport.

**Proof (the book's, p. 48–49).** Both directions are contrapositives.

* *Not d-separated ⇒ not separated in the moral graph.* Take an active chain `π` from `A` to
  `B`. Every vertex of `π` lies in `An(A ∪ B ∪ S)`: at a head-to-head vertex `γ` activity forces
  `γ ∈ S` or `γ` to have a descendant in `S`, so `γ ∈ An(S)`; and any other vertex leads, along
  the arrows of `π`, either to a head-to-head vertex or all the way to an endpoint in `A ∪ B`.
  Each head-to-head meeting marries its two neighbours on `π` in the moral graph, so deleting
  the head-to-head vertices from `π` leaves a walk in `(G_{An(A∪B∪S)})^m` from `A` to `B`; its
  vertices are the non-head-to-head vertices of `π`, none of which lies in `S`, since `π` is
  active. (When the two neighbours of a head-to-head vertex coincide, no marriage edge is
  needed and the walk simply stays put — this is where allowing repeated vertices in `Chain`
  costs nothing.)
* *Not separated in the moral graph ⇒ not d-separated.* A walk in `(G_{An(A∪B∪S)})^m`
  circumventing `S` has pieces that are arrows of `D` and pieces that are marriages. Each
  marriage comes from a head-to-head meeting at some `γ`. If `γ ∈ S`, or `γ` has a descendant
  in `S`, the meeting does not block. If not, then `γ` must have a descendant in `A ∪ B` —
  *because the ancestral set was the smallest one* — and rerouting along that line of descent
  produces a chain with one head-to-head meeting fewer. Iterating terminates in an active chain
  from `A` to `B`.

Note where acyclicity is used: in "the ancestral set was smallest", i.e. in the fact that a
vertex of `An(A ∪ B ∪ S)` which is not an ancestor of `S` must be an ancestor of `A ∪ B`.

**As formalized.** Each contrapositive is a single structural recursion —
`exists_moralWalk_of_active` and `exists_active_chain_of_moralWalk` above — and neither
*iterates*. In particular the book's "rerouting produces a chain with one head-to-head meeting
fewer, and iterating terminates" is replaced by a disjunctive conclusion: the reroute at the
first blocking collider either keeps the walk's prefix (`t ∈ B`) and hands the caller a chain to
extend, or keeps its suffix (`t ∈ A`) and is already a finished answer. So no well-founded
measure on the number of blocking colliders is needed.

*The three disjointness hypotheses are not used.* Both constructions are local — activity of the
chain, respectively `S`-avoidance of the walk, supplies every non-membership of `S` that is
needed — so the equivalence holds for arbitrary `A`, `B`, `S`. They are kept because the book
assumes them: its blocking rule is stated for disjoint blocks. -/

/-- **The book's phrasing of d-separation**, over chains whose vertices are *distinct*.
Lauritzen's chains (§2.1.1, p. 6) are vertex-distinct sequences; `Chain` drops that requirement
(module docstring, note 1). The two readings of d-separation agree.

*This is not the undirected argument.* `separates_iff_forall_path` follows from
`SimpleGraph.Walk.bypass`, which shortens a walk to a path with smaller support; the same move
is **unavailable** here, because deleting a repeated section of a chain can turn a non-collider
into a **collider** and so turn an active chain into a blocked one.

⚠️ **Nor does it follow from Proposition 3.25 applied twice.** Nothing here proves
Proposition 3.25 *for the vertex-distinct reading*, and the equivalence cannot be obtained from
`dSeparated_iff_separates_moralGraph_ancestralClosure` by rewriting, because the chain that
`exists_active_chain_of_moralWalk` builds out of a moral walk need not have distinct vertices
(two marriage edges may share a witness, and a rerouting line of descent may re-meet the walk).
Getting a *vertex-distinct* chain out of that construction is a strictly stronger statement than
the one proved above.

**What is proved instead: bypass, repaired.** Take an active chain from `a` to `b` of **minimal
length**. If it repeated a vertex `x`, deleting the stretch between two occurrences would leave a
shorter chain, and `Chain.exists_shorter_of_not_nodup` shows that chain is still active — the
merged occurrence of `x` cannot block. The one configuration in which it could — `x` becoming a
collider with no descendant in `S` — is impossible on an active chain: if the chain leaves `x`
*along* an arrow at the first occurrence, `Chain.forward_run` forces every later vertex, the
second occurrence of `x` included, to be a descendant of `x`, i.e. a **directed cycle**; and if
it leaves against an arrow, the first occurrence is already a collider (so activity supplies the
descendant in `S`) or is not one (so neither is the merged occurrence). Minimality therefore
forces distinct vertices, and the two readings agree.

*Consequences for the signature.* Acyclicity is genuinely used — it is what kills the cycle
above, and `Chain.exists_shorter_of_not_nodup` carries it as `IsAcyclicRel`. The three
**disjointness hypotheses are not used at all**: the argument is chain-local and never looks at
where `A`, `B` and `S` meet. They are kept to match Proposition 3.25's statement. -/

/-- **d-separation implies conditional independence** — Lauritzen **Proposition 3.25** (p. 48)
composed with **Corollary 3.23** (p. 47).

⚠️ *Two citations, deliberately.* The book **defines** the directed global Markov property (DG)
by the moral-graph criterion of Corollary 3.23 and proves *separately*, in Proposition 3.25,
that d-separation is the same relation. There is no single numbered result in Lauritzen saying
"d-separation ⟹ conditional independence", and citing one number for this theorem would
misattribute it. The Lean proof is the composition: rewrite along
`dSeparated_iff_separates_moralGraph_ancestralClosure`, then apply the hypothesis.

Stated against the **abstract** relation `ci : Finset V → Finset V → Finset V → Prop` (read
`ci A B S` as `X_A ⫫ X_B ∣ X_S`), as everything in `Undirected.Markov` is, so that every model
class — the discrete mass relation, the Gaussian precision relation, the general `CondIndep` —
gets the criterion once (Lauritzen's own remark after Proposition 3.4, p. 33, that these
arguments depend only on the calculus). -/
