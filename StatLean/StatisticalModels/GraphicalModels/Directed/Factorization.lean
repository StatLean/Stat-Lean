# Recursive factorization over a DAG — property (DF)

Lauritzen's factorization property for **directed** acyclic graphs (p. 46, unnumbered): a mass
function factorizes recursively according to `D` when it is a product of one *kernel* per
vertex,
`p(x) = ∏_{v ∈ V} k_v(x_v, x_{pa(v)})`,
each `k_v` non-negative and normalised to `1` in its first argument. The whole point of the
property is **Lemma 3.21**: it transports into the undirected layer, where `Discrete/` and
`Undirected/` already prove everything, because `{v} ∪ pa(v)` is a *clique* of the moral graph —
that is exactly what marrying the parents of a common child buys.

We work in the **same discrete setting as round 1** — `V` and `α` finite, `p : (V → α) → ℝ≥0∞`,
marginals `blockMarginal`, conditional independence `CondIndepMass` — so that
`Discrete/Factorization.factorizesOver_implies_globalMarkov` and the whole graphoid calculus of
`Discrete/CondIndep.lean` apply verbatim to whatever this file produces. Nothing here is
re-proved from scratch: the directed theory is *routed through* the undirected one.

* `IsLocalKernelOn` / `IsLocalKernel` — Lauritzen's kernels `k^α(·, ·)` on
  `𝒳_α × 𝒳_{pa(α)}`: each depends only on the coordinates of `{v} ∪ pa(v)` and sums to `1`
  over its own coordinate;
* `RecursivelyFactorizesOn` / `RecursivelyFactorizes` — property **(DF)**, p. 46, in a
  block form and its `V`-wide instance;
* `inducedMoralGraph` — the moral graph of the sub-DAG induced on a vertex block, i.e.
  Lauritzen's `(𝒢_A)^m`; a one-line composite of the concurrent `DAG.induced` and
  `DAG.moralGraph`, kept here only because `Directed/Moralization.lean` is not this batch's
  file to edit;
* `factorizesOver_of_recursivelyFactorizesOn` — the graph-free hinge: any undirected graph in
  which every `{v} ∪ pa(v)` is complete receives the factorization;
* **`recursivelyFactorizes_implies_factorizesOver_moralGraph`** — Lauritzen **Lemma 3.21**,
  p. 47, and `recursivelyFactorizes_implies_globalMarkov_moralGraph` its second half
  ("and obeys therefore the global Markov property relative to `𝒢^m`"), which is a one-liner
  over round 1;
* `recursivelyFactorizesOn_implies_factorizesOver_inducedMoralGraph` — Lemma 3.21 read on the
  sub-DAG induced on an ancestral set, the form `Directed/Markov.lean` consumes for
  Corollary 3.23;
* `sum_update_prod_of_notMem_parents` — the induction step of everything below: summing a
  childless vertex out of the product telescopes, *because* the kernels are normalised;
* **`blockMarginal_recursivelyFactorizesOn_of_ancestralSet`** — Lauritzen **Proposition 3.22**,
  p. 47: the marginal on an ancestral set factorizes recursively over the induced sub-DAG;
* `sum_eq_one_of_recursivelyFactorizes` — a recursively factorizing mass has total mass `1`
  (the "easy induction argument" of p. 46).

**Reference.** S. L. Lauritzen, *Graphical Models*, Oxford Statistical Science Series 17,
Clarendon Press, Oxford, **1996**, §3.2.2: the recursive factorization property (DF) is the
**unnumbered** display on p. 46 (`∫ k^α(y_α, x_{pa(α)}) μ_α(dy_α) = 1` and
`f(x) = ∏_{α ∈ V} k^α(x_α, x_{pa(α)})`); **Lemma 3.21** (p. 47) is "if `P` admits a recursive
factorization according to `𝒢`, it factorizes according to the moral graph `𝒢^m` and obeys
therefore the global Markov property relative to `𝒢^m`"; **Proposition 3.22** (p. 47) is "if `P`
admits a recursive factorization according to `𝒢` and `A` is an ancestral set, then the marginal
`P_A` admits a recursive factorization according to `𝒢_A`". The remark that the kernels are the
conditional densities of `X_α` given `X_{pa(α)}` is on p. 46 (`Lauritzen §3.2.2` in tags).

**Proof formalization notes.** *Book vs Lean, five deliberate differences.*

1. **Counting measure, so the integral is a sum.** Lauritzen's normalisation is
   `∫ k^α(y_α, x_{pa(α)}) μ_α(dy_α) = 1` for a σ-finite `μ_α`; here `μ_α` is counting measure on
   the finite `α`, so it reads `∑ a : α, k_v (Function.update x v a) = 1`. Varying `x` at the
   single coordinate `v` is exactly varying `y_α` — `k_v` does not see any other coordinate of
   the update because it depends only on `{v} ∪ pa(v)` and `v ∉ pa(v)` (acyclicity).
2. **Kernels are functions of the whole configuration.** As in `Discrete/CondIndep.lean` and
   `Discrete/Factorization.lean`, `k v : (V → α) → ℝ≥0∞` constrained by
   `DependsOn (k v) ↑(insert v (D.parents v))`, rather than a function on
   `α × (↥(D.parents v) → α)`. The two readings are interchangeable
   (`dependsOn_iff_exists_comp`); a single type is what makes `∏ v, k v x` a plain
   `Finset.prod`.
3. **A block form, `…On`, is primitive.** Lauritzen's Proposition 3.22 says the *marginal on an
   ancestral set `A`* factorizes recursively "according to `𝒢_A`". In a formalisation where the
   sub-DAG `𝒢_A` still lives on the full vertex type `V`, "recursive factorization according to
   `𝒢_A`" cannot be the product over **all** of `V`: that product is a probability mass on
   `V → α`, whereas the marginal is constant in the coordinates outside `A` and hence has total
   mass `#α ^ #(V ∖ A)`. The faithful statement is the product over `A`, which is precisely
   `RecursivelyFactorizesOn D A`. Because `A` is ancestral, `pa_{𝒢_A}(v) = pa_𝒢(v)` for every
   `v ∈ A`, so a `D`-local kernel family *is* a `𝒢_A`-local one on `A` and no separate notion is
   needed. `RecursivelyFactorizes D = RecursivelyFactorizesOn D Finset.univ` recovers (DF).
4. **No positivity, no finiteness anywhere in this file.** Lemma 3.21 and Proposition 3.22 are
   identities between products and sums; positivity enters only in `Directed/Markov.lean`, at
   Theorem 3.27's reverse implication.
5. **`sum_eq_one_of_recursivelyFactorizes` needs `[Nonempty α]`, and the book's setting supplies
   it.** If `α` is empty and `V` is not, then `V → α` is empty, every `∀ x`-condition is vacuous,
   (DF) holds of *every* `p`, and the total mass is `0`. Lauritzen's state spaces `𝒳_α` are
   sample spaces of random variables and are never empty. No other statement in the file needs
   the hypothesis: they are all `∀ x` statements, hence vacuously true in that degenerate regime.

**On `inducedMoralGraph`.** `Directed/Moralization.lean` (concurrent batch) owns moralization and
the induced sub-DAG; this file only *composes* them, so that the composite has one name and one
place to be repaired. If that file ships the composite under its own name, delete this one and
repoint. The intended reading of `inducedMoralGraph D T` is Lauritzen's `(𝒢_T)^m`: keep only the
vertices of `T` and the arrows between them, marry parents-within-`T` of a common child in `T`,
then drop directions. It is *not* the same as `(D.moralGraph)` restricted to `T` — a marriage
created by a child outside `T` survives in the latter and must not survive in the former, and
that difference is exactly what makes the directed global Markov property sharp.

**Reuse (binding).** From `Directed/DAG.lean`: `DAG`, `DAG.parents`, `DAG.AncestralSet`,
`DAG.induced`. From `Directed/Moralization.lean`: `DAG.moralGraph` and the fact that
`{v} ∪ pa(v)` is complete in it. From `Discrete/Factorization.lean`: `FactorizesOver`,
`IsCliquePotential`, `completeSubsets`, `mem_completeSubsets` and
**`factorizesOver_implies_globalMarkov`** — the undirected (F) ⇒ (G) is never re-proved here.
From `Discrete/CondIndep.lean`: `blockMarginal`, `agreeOn`, `dependsOn_blockMarginal`,
`blockMarginal_univ`. From Mathlib: `DependsOn`, `DependsOn.mono`, `Function.update`,
`Finset.prod_fiberwise_of_maps_to`, `Finset.prod_congr`, `Finset.mul_prod_erase`.

**Bibliographic comments.** Recursive factorization on a DAG and its equivalence with the
directed Markov properties are due to H. Kiiveri, T. P. Speed and J. B. Carlin, "Recursive causal
models," *J. Austral. Math. Soc. Ser. A* **36** (1984), 30–52 — Lauritzen's own attribution on
p. 46 — with the moralization device and the global reading developed by J. Pearl and
T. Verma (1987), T. Verma and J. Pearl (1990), and S. L. Lauritzen, A. P. Dawid, B. N. Larsen and
H.-G. Leimer, "Independence properties of directed Markov fields," *Networks* **20** (1990),
491–505. Mathlib has no directed-graphical-model vocabulary; every ingredient below the
`DAG`/moralization layer (`Finset.prod`, `DependsOn`, `SimpleGraph.IsClique`) is Mathlib's.

/-! ### Local kernels -/

/-- **Lauritzen's kernels** `k^α(·, ·)` (p. 46, unnumbered), restricted to a block `A`: for every
`v ∈ A` the factor `k v` depends on the configuration only through the coordinates of
`{v} ∪ pa(v)`, and it is a probability mass function in its own coordinate — summing it over the
`v`-coordinate, with all other coordinates held fixed, gives `1`.

*Book vs Lean.* The book's normalisation `∫ k^α(y_α, x_{pa(α)}) μ_α(dy_α) = 1` is a sum here,
counting measure being the dominating measure of the discrete setting; and `y_α ↦ ·` is realised
as `Function.update x v ·`, which by the dependence condition moves exactly the argument `y_α`.

*Edge behaviour.* Nothing is required of `k v` for `v ∉ A` — those factors never enter the
products below. Kernels are `ℝ≥0∞`-valued and are not required to be finite pointwise, only
summable to `1`, which does force each value to be `≤ 1`. On a vertex with no parents the
condition says `k v` is a probability mass function on `α` alone. -/

/-! ### Property (DF) -/

/-- **Recursive factorization over a block** — the shape Lauritzen's Proposition 3.22 (p. 47)
produces: `p(x) = ∏_{v ∈ A} k_v(x_v, x_{pa(v)})` for a kernel family local on `A`.

*Book vs Lean.* For an **ancestral** `A` this *is* the book's "admits a recursive factorization
according to `𝒢_A`": the induced sub-DAG has `pa_{𝒢_A}(v) = pa_𝒢(v)` for every `v ∈ A`, so the
kernel family of `𝒢_A` and that of `𝒢` are the same object read on `A`. Taking the product over
`A` rather than over `V` is forced: a marginal on `A` does not depend on the coordinates outside
`A`, so it cannot be a product of `#V` normalised kernels (see module docstring, note 3).

*Edge behaviour.* `RecursivelyFactorizesOn D ∅ p` says `p ≡ 1`, the empty product — the
degenerate marginal "on no variables" of a probability mass function. -/

/-- **Property (DF), recursive factorization** — Lauritzen p. 46, unnumbered:
`p(x) = ∏_{v ∈ V} k_v(x_v, x_{pa(v)})` for a family of normalised kernels.

*Edge behaviour.* A recursively factorizing mass automatically has total mass `1`
(`sum_eq_one_of_recursivelyFactorizes`), so — unlike `FactorizesOver` in the undirected file —
(DF) is *not* invariant under rescaling `p`. That asymmetry is the book's: Lauritzen's `f` is the
density of a probability distribution and his kernels are conditional densities. On the empty DAG
(no arrows) it says `p` is a product of one-dimensional probability mass functions, i.e. the
coordinates are independent; on a complete DAG it says nothing beyond `∑ p = 1`. -/

/-! ### The moral graph of an induced sub-DAG

`Directed/Moralization.lean` owns `DAG.moralGraph` and the induced sub-DAG; the composite below
exists only so that Lauritzen's `(𝒢_A)^m` has a single name here and a single place to be
repointed. See the module docstring. -/

/-- **Lauritzen's `(𝒢_T)^m`** (p. 47, Corollary 3.23): moralize the sub-DAG induced on `T`.

*Not* `D.moralGraph` restricted to `T` — a marriage of two vertices of `T` created by a common
child *outside* `T` belongs to the latter and must be absent from the former. That difference is
what makes the directed global Markov property sharp, and it is why the ancestral closure appears
in Corollary 3.23 at all. -/

/-! ### Lemma 3.21 — into the undirected layer -/

/-- **The hinge, stated without any moral vocabulary.** If every set `{v} ∪ pa(v)`, `v ∈ A`, is
*complete* in an undirected graph `G`, then a mass function that factorizes recursively over `A`
factorizes over `G` in the undirected sense (F).

This is the content of Lauritzen's proof of Lemma 3.21 — "the sets `{α} ∪ pa(α)` are complete in
`𝒢^m` and we can therefore let `ψ_{{α}∪pa(α)} = k^α`" — isolated from moralization, so that both
Lemma 3.21 and its ancestral-restriction form below are instantiations. Route: send `v` to the
complete set `insert v (D.parents v)` and let `ψ c` be the product of the `k v` in that fibre
(`Finset.prod_fiberwise_of_maps_to`); `DependsOn (ψ c) ↑c` because every factor in the fibre
depends on `c` on the nose, and the potentials of the complete sets that receive no vertex are
the empty product `1`. -/

/-- **Lauritzen Lemma 3.21**, p. 47, first half: a mass function admitting a recursive

This is the hinge of the entire directed theory: it is the only place where a directed statement
becomes an undirected one, and everything downstream — Corollary 3.23, the directed hierarchy,
Theorem 3.27 — is obtained by feeding this into round 1 rather than by re-proving anything.

Route: `factorizesOver_of_recursivelyFactorizesOn` at `A = Finset.univ` and `G = D.moralGraph`,
whose clique hypothesis is precisely the defining property of moralization (marrying the parents
of a common child makes `{v} ∪ pa(v)` complete). -/

Ancestrality is what makes the clique hypothesis of `factorizesOver_of_recursivelyFactorizesOn`
payable: for `v ∈ T` it gives `pa(v) ⊆ T`, hence `pa_{𝒢_T}(v) = pa(v)`, hence
`{v} ∪ pa(v)` is a set of vertices of `𝒢_T` married by the moralization of `𝒢_T` itself. Without
it, `{v} ∪ pa(v)` need not even be contained in `T`. -/

/-! ### Proposition 3.22 — restriction to an ancestral set -/

/-- **The induction step of the directed theory: summing out a childless vertex telescopes.**
If `v ∈ A` has no children inside `A`, then summing the product `∏_{u ∈ A} k_u` over the
`v`-coordinate deletes exactly the factor `k_v`.

Two facts do the work, and they are the two halves of `IsLocalKernelOn`: every other factor
`k_u`, `u ∈ A ∖ {v}`, is *constant* along the `v`-coordinate, since it depends only on
`{u} ∪ pa(u)`, which misses `v` (that is the childlessness hypothesis); and the factor `k_v`
sums to `1`, which is the normalisation. This lemma is Lauritzen's "easy induction argument"
(p. 46) in one line, and both `blockMarginal_recursivelyFactorizesOn_of_ancestralSet` and
`sum_eq_one_of_recursivelyFactorizes` are inductions on it. -/

/-- **Lauritzen Proposition 3.22**, p. 47: if `P` admits a recursive factorization according to
`𝒢` and `A` is an **ancestral** set, then the marginal `P_A` admits a recursive factorization
according to `𝒢_A`.

*Book vs Lean.* "According to `𝒢_A`" is `RecursivelyFactorizesOn D A`: the same kernel family,
multiplied over `A` only. Ancestrality gives `pa(v) ⊆ A` for `v ∈ A`, so the `𝒢`-kernels *are*
the `𝒢_A`-kernels there, and the product over `A` depends on `x` only through `x_A`, as a
marginal must. See module docstring, note 3, for why the product cannot run over all of `V`.

Route: induct on `A`'s complement. Ancestrality of `A` makes `V ∖ A` closed under children, so
the induced sub-DAG on `V ∖ A` — finite and acyclic — has a vertex `u` with no children at all;
`sum_update_prod_of_notMem_parents` deletes `k_u` from the product and `A ∪ (V ∖ A ∖ {u})` is
again ancestral. `blockMarginal_univ` starts the induction and `dependsOn_blockMarginal`
identifies the surviving product with the marginal.

*Degenerate regime.* With `α` empty and `V` nonempty both sides quantify over an empty
configuration space, so the statement is vacuously true; no `[Nonempty α]` is needed. -/

/-- **A recursively factorizing mass is a probability mass function** — Lauritzen's remark on

is the first consequence.

This is the reason (DF) is *not* scale-invariant, unlike the undirected `FactorizesOver`, and
therefore the reason Theorem 3.27 carries an explicit normalisation hypothesis on `p` in the
direction that produces (DF).
