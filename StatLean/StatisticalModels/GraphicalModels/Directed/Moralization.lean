# Moralization — the undirected graph `G^m` of a directed acyclic graph

Lauritzen's *moral graph* (§2.1.1, p. 7, unnumbered): marry the parents — join every pair of
vertices with a common child — and then drop the directions. The result is an **undirected**
graph, so the undirected vocabulary (`Core.Separation.Separates`,
`Undirected.Markov.IsGlobalMarkov`, `Discrete.Factorization.FactorizesOver`) applies to a
directed model, and the directed theorems are proved by **transport** to `G^m` rather than by a
parallel directed development.

* `DAG.moralRel` — the relation "edge, or common child", the input to `SimpleGraph.fromRel`;
* `DAG.moralGraph` — the moral graph `G^m`, with its adjacency characterisation
  `DAG.moralGraph_adj` and a `DecidableRel` instance (needed because `IsLocalMarkov`,
  `completeSubsets` and `neighborFinset` all demand one);
* `DAG.skeleton` — the underlying undirected graph obtained by dropping directions **only**, and
  `DAG.skeleton_le_moralGraph`: moralization only adds edges;
* `DAG.moralGraph_adj_of_adj` — an edge of the DAG survives moralization;
  `DAG.moralGraph_adj_of_common_child`, `DAG.moralGraph_adj_of_mem_parents` — two parents of a
  common child become adjacent;
* `DAG.isClique_insert_parents` — the *family* `fa(v) = {v} ∪ pa(v)` is complete in `G^m`. This
  is the ingredient of Lauritzen's Lemma 3.21 (p. 47): a recursive factorization is a product of
  factors supported on the sets `fa(v)`, each of which is a clique of `G^m`, hence a
  factorization over `G^m` in the sense of `Discrete.Factorization.FactorizesOver`;
* `DAG.moralGraph_mono` — monotonicity in the DAG;
* `DAG.moralGraph_induce_adj`, `DAG.moralGraph_induce_le`,
  `DAG.isClique_insert_parents_induce` — moralization of the sub-DAG induced on a block, i.e.
  `(G_A)^m`. Lauritzen's Corollary 3.23 and Proposition 3.25 are stated at
  `A = An(A ∪ B ∪ S)`, so `(G_{An(A∪B∪S)})^m` is *the* object of interest.

**Reference.** S. L. Lauritzen, *Graphical Models*, Oxford Statistical Science Series 17,
Clarendon Press, Oxford, **1996**, §2.1.1, p. 7: the moral graph `G^m` of a directed acyclic
graph `G` is obtained "by first *marrying the parents*, i.e. adding undirected edges between
unmarried parents with a common child, and then dropping directions". This is an **unnumbered**
definition — there is no "Definition 2.x" to cite. The uses this file is built for are
**Lemma 3.21** and **Corollary 3.23** (p. 47, a recursive factorization factorizes over the
moral graph, hence property (DG)) and **Proposition 3.25** (p. 48, d-separation is separation in
`(G_{An(A∪B∪S)})^m`); the notation `An(·)` and `G_A` is §2.1.1, p. 7
(`Lauritzen §2.1.1` in tags).

**Proof formalization notes.** *Book vs Lean, four deliberate differences.*

1. **"Unmarried parents" versus all parents.** Lauritzen adds edges between parents that are
   *not already adjacent*; we take the union of the edge relation with the common-child relation
   in one step. The two graphs are identical — adding an edge that is already present is a
   no-op — and the one-step form is the input `SimpleGraph.fromRel` takes.
2. **`SimpleGraph.fromRel` supplies symmetry and looplessness.** `fromRel r` has
   `Adj a b ↔ a ≠ b ∧ (r a b ∨ r b a)`, which is exactly "symmetrize, then delete the
   diagonal". Deleting the diagonal is faithful, not a repair: the marriage relation is between
   *pairs* of parents, so a vertex is never married to itself, and `D.Adj u u` is impossible in
   a DAG anyway (`DAG.irrefl`).
3. **`(G_A)^m` is not `G^m` restricted to `A`, and the order of operations matters.** Two
   vertices of `A` whose only common child lies *outside* `A` are married in `G^m` but not in
   `(G_A)^m`. `DAG.moralGraph_induce_adj` makes the difference visible (the witness `w` is
   quantified over `A`), and `DAG.moralGraph_induce_le` records that only the one inclusion
   holds. This is precisely why Lauritzen restricts to an ancestral set *before* moralizing in
   Corollary 3.23 — and why `DAG.parents_induce_of_isAncestralSet` (in `Directed.DAG`) is the
   load-bearing lemma: on an ancestral set the parent sets, hence the families `fa(v)` and hence
   the clique structure of `DAG.isClique_insert_parents_induce`, are unchanged.
4. **Vertices outside `A` survive as isolated points.** Since `DAG.induce` keeps the vertex type
   `V` fixed (see `Directed.DAG`, note 5), so does `(G_A)^m`: `DAG.moralGraph_induce_adj` shows
   every edge of it has both endpoints in `A`. Separation statements about blocks inside `A` are
   therefore unaffected, and `Separates`, `IsGlobalMarkov` and the clique vocabulary apply
   without any subtype transport.

**Bibliographic comments.** Moralization is due to S. L. Lauritzen and D. J. Spiegelhalter,
"Local computations with probabilities on graphical structures and their application to expert
systems," *J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B* **50** (1988), 157–224, where it is the first step of
the junction-tree construction; the equivalence of d-separation (J. Pearl, *Probabilistic
Reasoning in Intelligent Systems*, Morgan Kaufmann, 1988) with separation in the moralized
ancestral subgraph is Lauritzen's Proposition 3.25, and is the reason this file exists.

/-! ### The moral graph -/

/-- The relation moralization symmetrizes: `u` is either a **parent** of `v`, or a **co-parent**
of `v` — the two share a child. Feeding this to `SimpleGraph.fromRel` performs the book's two
steps ("marry the parents", "drop directions") at once.

*Edge behaviour.* `moralRel D v v` may hold (a vertex with a child is trivially its own
co-parent); the diagonal is deleted by `SimpleGraph.fromRel`, which is faithful to the book
since marriage is a relation between *pairs* of parents. -/
def moralRel (D : DAG V) (u v : V) : Prop :=
  D.Adj u v ∨ ∃ w : V, D.Adj u w ∧ D.Adj v w

/-- The marriage relation is decidable on a finite vertex set: the common child is an existential

/-- The **moral graph** `G^m` of a directed acyclic graph (Lauritzen §2.1.1, p. 7, unnumbered):
join every pair of vertices sharing a child ("marry the parents"), then drop the directions.

Built through `SimpleGraph.fromRel`, so the result is a genuine `SimpleGraph V` — symmetric and
loopless by construction — and the undirected vocabulary (`Separates`, the three Markov
properties, clique factorization) applies to it. The directed theorems of Lauritzen §3.2.2 are
proved by moving to `G^m`, not by redeveloping separation for directed graphs.

*Edge behaviour.* Moralization only adds edges (`DAG.skeleton_le_moralGraph`); it is idempotent
in the informal sense that marrying already-adjacent parents changes nothing (module docstring,
note 1). On a DAG with no vertex having two distinct parents, `G^m` is exactly the skeleton. -/

joined by the surviving directed edge. This is the lemma that turns a recursive factorization —
a product of factors each supported on some `fa(v)` — into a factorization over the cliques of
