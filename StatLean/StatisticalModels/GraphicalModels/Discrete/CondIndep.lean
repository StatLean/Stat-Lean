# Conditional independence of a discrete mass function — Lauritzen's identity (3.2)

The finite-state model class: a vertex set `V`, a state space `α`, both finite, configurations
`V → α`, and a **mass function** `p : (V → α) → ℝ≥0∞`. This is the layer where the whole
graphoid calculus becomes elementary algebra of finite sums and products, and it is the layer
that the factorization theory (`Discrete/Factorization.lean`) consumes.

* `agreeOn A x` — the configurations that agree with `x` on the block `A`;
* `blockMarginal A p` — the **marginal mass on `A`**, `p_A(x) = ∑ p(y)` over `y ∈ agreeOn A x`;
  the file's workhorse, together with its API (`dependsOn_blockMarginal`,
  `blockMarginal_univ`, `blockMarginal_antitone`, `blockMarginal_ne_top`, and the
  block-splitting identity `blockMarginal_eq_sum_updateFinset`);
* `CondIndepMass p A B C` — Lauritzen's **eq. (3.2)**, `p_{A∪B∪C}·p_C = p_{A∪C}·p_{B∪C}`;
* `CondIndepMass.symm` / `.decomposition` / `.weakUnion` / `.contraction` / `.intersection` —
  the five properties (C1)–(C5), each stated with exactly the hypotheses it needs;
* **`isSemigraphoid_condIndepMass`** — the headline: (C1)–(C4) hold for **every** finite mass
  function, so the abstract Markov hierarchy of `Undirected/Markov.lean` instantiates here;
* **`isGraphoid_condIndepMass_of_pos`** — (C5) as well, under strict positivity: Lauritzen
  **Proposition 3.1**, p. 29;
* `condIndepMass_of_exists_factorization` / `condIndepMass_iff_exists_factorization` —
  Lauritzen's **eq. (3.6)**, `f(x, y, z) = h(x, z) k(y, z)`; this is what the factorization
  file consumes, and the `mpr` half is deliberately separated out because it needs neither
  finiteness nor positivity;
* `condIndepMass_of_condIndepCoords` — the bridge from the general measure-theoretic
  `CondIndepCoords` of `Core/Coordinates.lean` down to the mass identity.

**Carrier choice.** `p : (V → α) → ℝ≥0∞`, a bare function with **no** normalisation built in
(this is the frozen contract's shape, `notes/factor_graphical/contract.md`). Three reasons.
(i) Lauritzen's identity (3.2) is homogeneous of degree two in `p` — replacing `p` by `c·p`
scales both sides by `c²` — so normalisation is genuinely irrelevant to (C1)–(C5) and putting
it in the carrier would be a hypothesis nobody uses. (ii) `ℝ≥0∞` is a complete commutative
semiring in which every finite sum and product is defined and no subtraction is ever needed, so
each axiom is a rearrangement of sums and products; a `PMF` carrier would add a coercion to
every algebraic step (and `PMF.pi` does not exist in this pin), and a `Measure (V → α)` carrier
would route the same algebra through `lintegral`/`Measure.map`. (iii) The `Measure` reading is
recovered exactly once, in `condIndepMass_of_condIndepCoords`, at `p := fun x => μ (X ⁻¹' {x})`.

**Reference.** S. L. Lauritzen, *Graphical Models*, Oxford Statistical Science Series 17,
Clarendon Press, Oxford, **1996**, §3.1: the density identity **(3.2)**
`f_{XYZ}(x,y,z) f_Z(z) = f_{XZ}(x,z) f_{YZ}(y,z)` is on p. 28, the equivalent factorisation
criterion **(3.6)** `f(x,y,z) = h(x,z) k(y,z)` on p. 29, the properties **(C1)–(C4)** are the
unnumbered labelled list on p. 29 and **(C5)** is on p. 30, and **Proposition 3.1** (p. 29) is
the statement that a strictly positive continuous density satisfies (C5). Lauritzen remarks on
p. 28 that on a discrete space every function is continuous, so the continuity hypothesis of
Proposition 3.1 is vacuous here (`Lauritzen §3.1`).

**Proof formalization notes.** *Book vs Lean, four deliberate differences.*

1. **Marginals are functions of the whole configuration.** Lauritzen's `f_A` is a function of
   `x_A`; ours is a function of the full `x : V → α` that happens to depend only on the
   coordinates in `A` (`dependsOn_blockMarginal`, using Mathlib's `DependsOn`). This keeps
   every quantity in (3.2) in a *single* type, so the identity is a plain equation in `ℝ≥0∞`
   rather than a statement modulo the transport maps `Finset.restrict₂` that a subtype-indexed
   marginal would force. It costs nothing: the two readings are interchangeable through
   `dependsOn_iff_exists_comp`.
2. **`ℝ≥0∞` cancellation is not free, and the axioms are stated accordingly.** (C1) and (C2)
   are pure sum rearrangements and hold for an arbitrary `p`. (C3), (C4) and (C5) all divide by
   a marginal, which in `ℝ≥0∞` is legitimate only away from `0` and `∞`. The `0` case is
   *derivable* — `blockMarginal_antitone` makes every marginal over a larger block vanish with
   the smaller one, and both sides of the conclusion then collapse to `0` — so the only genuine
   side condition is `hp : ∀ x, p x ≠ ∞`, which for a finite `V` and finite `α` is exactly
   finiteness of the total mass. It is carried by (C3), (C4), (C5) and by nothing else. (C5)
   additionally needs `hpos`, per Proposition 3.1.
3. **Positivity is an assumption of Proposition 3.1, not a convenience.** (C5) is *false* for
   general masses: Lauritzen's counterexample (p. 30) takes `X = Y = Z` uniform on `{0, 1}`.
   So `isGraphoid_condIndepMass_of_pos` carries `hpos : ∀ x, p x ≠ 0` and
   `isSemigraphoid_condIndepMass` does not claim intersection.
4. **Disjointness.** `IsSemigraphoid`/`IsGraphoid` state (C1)–(C5) for pairwise disjoint blocks,
   matching the book. The standalone lemmas below record the *minimal* disjointness each
   identity actually uses — (C2) needs only `Disjoint A D`, (C4) needs none at all — so the
   bundling theorems discard the unused fields rather than the lemmas silently assuming them.

**Reuse (binding).** Nothing is re-derived here. `DependsOn` is Mathlib's
(`Logic/Function/DependsOn.lean`), including `DependsOn.mono` and `dependsOn_iff_exists_comp`;
`Function.updateFinset` (`Data/Finset/Update.lean`) is the block-substitution operator;
`Finset.restrict` (`Data/Finset/Pi.lean:161`) is inherited through `coords`; the sum algebra is
`Finset.sum_le_sum_of_subset`, `Finset.mul_sum`, `Finset.sum_mul`, `Finset.sum_mul_sum`
(`Algebra/BigOperators/Ring/Finset.lean`) and `Finset.sum_sigma`/`Fintype.sum_prod_type`; the
cancellation steps are `ENNReal.mul_left_inj` / `ENNReal.mul_right_inj`
(`Data/ENNReal/Operations.lean:72`/`:76`) and `ENNReal.div_mul_cancel` (`Inv.lean:175`); the
measure-side bridge consumes `MeasureTheory.Measure.compProd_apply`,
`ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.prod_apply` and `IsMarkovKernel`. The graphoid structure and its
derived combinators are `Core/Semigraphoid.lean`, and the abstract Markov hierarchy is
`Undirected/Markov.lean`; neither is restated.

**Bibliographic comments.** The discrete factorisation criterion (3.6) is the working form of
conditional independence used throughout the Markov-random-field literature since
J. Besag, "Spatial interaction and the statistical analysis of lattice systems," *J. Roy.
Statist. Soc. Ser. B* **36** (1974), 192–236; the axiomatic reading of (C1)–(C5) is
A. P. Dawid, "Conditional independence in statistical theory," *ibid.* **41** (1979), 1–31,
with the names *symmetry / decomposition / weak union / contraction / intersection* due to
J. Pearl, *Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems*, Morgan Kaufmann, 1988. That
(C1)–(C4) are sound but not complete for probabilistic conditional independence is
M. Studený's theorem (1992); see the `Core/Semigraphoid.lean` docstring.

/-- The configurations that **agree with `x` on the block `A`**, i.e. the fibre of
`Finset.restrict A` through `x`. Summing `p` over this set is the marginal on `A`.

Edge behaviour: `agreeOn ∅ x = Finset.univ` (no constraint) and `agreeOn Finset.univ x = {x}`;
`x ∈ agreeOn A x` always, so the set is never empty — this is what makes a strictly positive
mass function have strictly positive marginals. -/

Edge behaviour: `blockMarginal Finset.univ p = p` (`blockMarginal_univ`) and
`blockMarginal ∅ p x = ∑ y, p y`, the total mass, for every `x`. The value at `x` depends only
on the coordinates of `x` inside `A` (`dependsOn_blockMarginal`), which is how it plays the
role of Lauritzen's function of `x_A`. No normalisation of `p` is assumed anywhere; the
marginal of an unnormalised mass is the corresponding unnormalised marginal. -/

/-! ### Lauritzen's identity (3.2) -/

/-- **Conditional independence of a discrete mass function**, Lauritzen **eq. (3.2)**, p. 28:
`X_A ⫫ X_B ∣ X_C` iff, for every configuration `x`,
`p_{A∪B∪C}(x) · p_C(x) = p_{A∪C}(x) · p_{B∪C}(x)`.

Edge behaviour and scope. Both sides depend on `x` only through `x_{A∪B∪C}`, so the universal
quantifier over the full configuration space is Lauritzen's quantifier over `(x_A, x_B, x_C)`.
No normalisation of `p` is required: the identity is homogeneous of degree two, so it holds for
`p` iff it holds for `c · p` for any `0 < c < ∞`. With `A = ∅` it is a tautology
(`∅ ∪ B ∪ C = B ∪ C` and `∅ ∪ C = C`), and likewise with `B = ∅`; with `C = ∅` it is
unconditional independence of the two blocks scaled by the total mass. For `p ≡ 0` it holds
vacuously, and for a `p` taking the value `∞` it is still a well-formed statement but the
cancellation lemmas below no longer apply — see `blockMarginal_ne_top`. -/

/-- **(C1), symmetry** (Lauritzen p. 29; Pearl's *symmetry*). Pure commutativity: `A ∪ B = B ∪ A`
and multiplication in `ℝ≥0∞` commutes. No hypothesis of any kind — in particular neither
finiteness nor disjointness. -/

over the coordinates in `D ∖ (A ∪ B ∪ C)` and never divides. Route: apply
`blockMarginal_eq_sum_updateFinset` with `T := D \ (A ∪ B ∪ C)` on both sides; the factors
`p_C` and `p_{A∪C}` are constant along `T` by `dependsOn_blockMarginal`, and the two set
identities `(A ∪ (B ∪ D) ∪ C) \ T = A ∪ B ∪ C` and `((B ∪ D) ∪ C) \ T = B ∪ C` — the second is

the two premises followed by one cancellation. Route: multiply the goal by `p_{C∪D}`, rewrite
the left-hand side by the first premise and then by the second, and observe that both sides
become `p_{A∪C} · p_{B∪C∪D} · p_{C∪D}`. Cancel `p_{C∪D}` by `ENNReal.mul_left_inj`; on the

/-! ### Helpers for (C5)

Lauritzen's Proposition 3.1 runs through the factorisation criterion (3.6), which is stated
below as `condIndepMass_of_exists_factorization`; since (C5) precedes it in the file's frozen
order, the content of that `mpr` half lives here as a private lemma, and the public theorem is
its instance. The rest of this section is the four-point identity that turns each premise of
(C5) into a statement free of the block it does not see. -/

/-- **(C5), intersection, under strict positivity** — Lauritzen **Proposition 3.1**, p. 29.

*Hypotheses.* Finiteness, strict positivity, and the book's full pairwise-disjointness
convention on the four blocks. Positivity is **not** removable: Lauritzen's counterexample on
p. 30 takes `X = Y = Z` uniform on `{0, 1}`, where both premises hold and the conclusion fails.
Continuity, the book's other hypothesis, is vacuous here — Lauritzen notes on p. 28 that every
function on a discrete space is continuous.

Route: under `hpos` every marginal lies in `(0, ∞)` (`blockMarginal_ne_zero`,
`blockMarginal_ne_top`), so both premises may be solved for the conditional masses; the first
exhibits `p_{A∪B∪C∪D}` as a product of a factor free of `x_D` and one free of `x_A`, the second
as a product of a factor free of `x_B` and one free of `x_A`, and combining them gives a
factorisation `h(x_{A∪C}) · k(x_{B∪D∪C})`, which is `condIndepMass_of_exists_factorization`. -/

/-! ### The graphoid instances -/

/-- **The headline of the file.** Every finite discrete mass function satisfies Lauritzen's
(C1)–(C4), so `CondIndepMass p` is a semi-graphoid and the abstract Markov hierarchy of
`Undirected/Markov.lean` — (G) ⇒ (L) ⇒ (P), Lauritzen Proposition 3.4 — instantiates at it
without further work.

The four fields are `CondIndepMass.symm`, `.decomposition`, `.weakUnion` and `.contraction`;
the structure's disjointness hypotheses are strictly more than those lemmas consume, and are
simply discarded. Only `hp` is needed, and only by (C3) and (C4). -/
theorem isSemigraphoid_condIndepMass {p : (V → α) → ℝ≥0∞}
    -- LEAN-ONLY: finiteness of the mass function; consumed by (C3) and (C4) only, and vacuous

    fun hAB _ _ _ _ _ h => CondIndepMass.weakUnion hp hAB h,
    fun _ _ _ _ _ _ h₁ h₂ => CondIndepMass.contraction hp h₁ h₂⟩

/-- **Lauritzen Proposition 3.1**, p. 29: a strictly positive (and, on a discrete space,
automatically continuous — Lauritzen p. 28) mass function satisfies (C5) as well, hence is a
**graphoid**. This is what makes Theorem 3.7 (Pearl–Paz, `pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov`)
available for strictly positive discrete models, and it is the calculus half of
Hammersley–Clifford. -/

/-! ### The factorisation criterion (3.6) -/

/-- **Lauritzen eq. (3.6) ⇒ (3.2)**, p. 29: if the joint marginal on `A ∪ B ∪ C` factors as
`h(x_{A∪C}) · k(x_{B∪C})`, then `X_A ⫫ X_B ∣ X_C`.

Stated separately from the equivalence below because this half needs **neither finiteness nor
positivity**: summing the factorisation over `A`, over `B`, and over `A ∪ B` gives
`p_{B∪C} = H·k`, `p_{A∪C} = h·K` and `p_C = H·K`, whence both sides of (3.2) equal
`h·k·H·K` by commutativity alone. It is this half that
`Discrete/Factorization.factorizesOver_implies_globalMarkov` consumes, which is why that
theorem carries no finiteness hypothesis either.

Route: three applications of `blockMarginal_eq_sum_updateFinset` (at `T := B`, `T := A` and
`T := A ∪ B`), `Finset.mul_sum`/`Finset.sum_mul` to pull the constant factor out of each sum —
constancy is `hh`/`hk` via `DependsOn` — and `Finset.sum_mul_sum` for the double sum. -/

    CondIndepMass p A B C :=
  condIndepMass_of_factorization hAB hAC hBC hh hk hfac

/-- **Lauritzen eq. (3.6)**, p. 29, as an equivalence: for a finite mass function,
`X_A ⫫ X_B ∣ X_C` holds **iff** the joint marginal factors as `h(x_{A∪C}) · k(x_{B∪C})`.

The `mpr` half is `condIndepMass_of_exists_factorization` (no side conditions). The `mp` half
takes `h := p_{A∪C}` and `k := p_{B∪C} / p_C`, whose dependence on `(x_B, x_C)` is
`dependsOn_blockMarginal` together with `DependsOn.mono` for the denominator; finiteness is
what makes `p_{A∪C} · (p_{B∪C} / p_C) = p_{A∪B∪C}` on `{p_C ≠ 0}` (`ENNReal.div_mul_cancel`),
and on `{p_C = 0}` both sides vanish by `blockMarginal_eq_zero_of_subset` — note that in
`ℝ≥0∞` the junk value `0 / 0 = 0` makes that branch work without a case split in the formula
itself. -/

/-! ### Bridge to the general conditional-independence predicate -/

/-- **Bridge: `CondIndepCoords ⇒ CondIndepMass`.** If the random vector `X` satisfies the
measure-theoretic conditional independence `X_A ⫫ X_B ∣ X_C` of `Core/Coordinates.lean`, then
its mass function `p x = μ (X ⁻¹' {x})` satisfies Lauritzen's identity (3.2).

Route: evaluate the disintegration identity
`μ.map (X_C, (X_A, X_B)) = (μ.map X_C) ⊗ₘ (κ ×ₖ η)` at the singleton `(x_C, (x_A, x_B))` using
`MeasureTheory.Measure.compProd_apply` and `ProbabilityTheory.Kernel.prod_apply`, obtaining
`p_{A∪B∪C}(x) = p_C(x) · κ(x_C){x_A} · η(x_C){x_B}`. Summing over the `B`-block and using
`IsMarkovKernel η` gives `p_{A∪C} = p_C · κ(x_C){x_A}`, and symmetrically for `p_{B∪C}`;
multiplying the two recovers (3.2). No disjointness of the blocks is used: agreement on
`A ∪ B ∪ C` is agreement on each of `A`, `B`, `C` whether or not they overlap.

**The converse direction is deliberately not stated here.** It is true, but it is a
*construction* rather than an identity: the witnessing kernels are the normalised conditional
masses `κ(z){a} = p_{A∪C}/p_C`, which need a junk fallback on the null set `{p_C = 0}` (hence a
`[Nonempty α]` hypothesis) and a `Kernel` packaging with its measurability proof. It belongs
with the discrete-kernel machinery, not with the mass algebra, and is left to a later lane; no
theorem of this area depends on it. -/
