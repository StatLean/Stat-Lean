# Factorization over the cliques of a graph — property (F)

Lauritzen's fourth Markov-type property: a mass function **factorizes** over an undirected
graph `G` when it is a product of non-negative factors, one for each complete vertex set, each
depending on the configuration only through its own coordinates. Together with
`Discrete/CondIndep.lean` (which supplies the graphoid calculus) this closes the discrete
chain (F) ⇒ (G) ⇒ (L) ⇒ (P) of Lauritzen's Proposition 3.8, and carries the
Hammersley–Clifford theorem.

* `completeSubsets G` — the `Finset` of complete vertex sets, assembled from Mathlib's
  `SimpleGraph.IsClique`;
* `IsCliquePotential G ψ` — a family of **clique potentials**: `ψ c` depends only on `x_c`;
* `FactorizesOver G p` — property **(F)**, Lauritzen eqs. **(3.11)/(3.12)**, pp. 34–35;
* `isClique_subset_or_of_separates` — the one graph-theoretic fact behind (F) ⇒ (G): a complete
  set cannot straddle a separator;
* `exists_factorization_of_separates` — the product splits across a separator into a factor on
  `A ∪ S` and a factor on `B ∪ S`;
* **`factorizesOver_implies_globalMarkov`** — Lauritzen **Proposition 3.8**, p. 35, (F) ⇒ (G),
  stated against the abstract `IsGlobalMarkov` of `Undirected/Markov.lean` instantiated at
  `CondIndepMass`;
* `factorizesOver_implies_localMarkov` / `factorizesOver_implies_pairwiseMarkov` — the rest of
  Proposition 3.8, by composition with the hierarchy;
* **`hammersleyClifford`** — Lauritzen **Theorem 3.9**, p. 36: for a *strictly positive* mass
  function, (P) ⟺ (F). Proved, by Möbius inversion of `log p` over the subset lattice; the
  private scaffolding is `sum_powerset_moebius`, `hcSub`/`hcH`/`hcPhi`,
  `crossRatio_of_condIndepMass` and `hcPhi_eq_zero_of_not_isClique`.

**Reference.** S. L. Lauritzen, *Graphical Models*, Oxford Statistical Science Series 17,
Clarendon Press, Oxford, **1996**: property (F) is the unnumbered definition on pp. 34–35 with
equations **(3.11)** (product over complete subsets) and **(3.12)** (product over cliques);
**Proposition 3.8** (p. 35) is (F) ⇒ (G) ⇒ (L) ⇒ (P); **Theorem 3.9** (p. 36) is the
Hammersley–Clifford theorem, that a positive and continuous density satisfies (P) iff it
factorizes; **Example 3.10** (pp. 37–38) is Moussouris's counterexample. Lauritzen remarks on
p. 28 that on a discrete space every function is continuous (`Lauritzen §3.2`).

**Proof formalization notes.** *Book vs Lean, four deliberate differences.*

1. **Complete subsets, not maximal cliques.** Lauritzen's (3.11) is a product over complete
   subsets and his (3.12) is the same product regrouped over the *maximal* complete subsets,
   which he calls cliques; the two properties are equivalent, since a potential attached to a
   complete set can be absorbed into any maximal complete set containing it. Mathlib's
   `SimpleGraph.IsClique` means *complete*, not maximal, so `FactorizesOver` is (3.11)
   verbatim, with `completeSubsets` — the filter of `Finset.univ : Finset (Finset V)` by
   `IsClique` — as its index family.
2. **The potentials are functions of the whole configuration.** As in `Discrete/CondIndep.lean`,
   `ψ c : (V → α) → ℝ≥0∞` with the constraint `DependsOn (ψ c) ↑c` (Mathlib's `DependsOn`),
   rather than a function on the subtype `↥c → α`. The two readings are interchangeable by
   `dependsOn_iff_exists_comp`; keeping a single type is what makes the product
   `∏ c ∈ completeSubsets G, ψ c x` a plain `Finset.prod` in `ℝ≥0∞`.
3. **No normalisation, no finiteness in (F) ⇒ (G).** Lauritzen's `f` is a density; ours is a
   bare `ℝ≥0∞`-valued mass. `factorizesOver_implies_globalMarkov` needs neither: it splits a
   product and then applies the division-free half of the criterion (3.6).
   Finiteness reappears only in
   `hammersleyClifford`, whose reverse implication runs through the graphoid calculus.
4. **The extension step in (F) ⇒ (G) is explicit.** The product only splits when the three
   blocks *cover* `V`. For a general separated triple `(A, B, S)` one first enlarges `A` to the
   union of the connected components of `G ∖ S` meeting `A`, sets `B'` to the rest, splits
   there, and then shrinks back with (C2), which needs neither finiteness nor positivity. The
   enlargement is spelled *with walks* —
   `A' = {v ∉ S | some walk from `A` to `v` avoids `S`}` — which is the same set as the union
   of the connected components of `G ∖ S` meeting `A`.

**Moussouris's example — why Theorem 3.9 needs positivity** (Lauritzen **Example 3.10**,
pp. 37–38). On the four-cycle `1 − 2 − 3 − 4 − 1` with binary states there is a mass function
that is globally Markov, hence pairwise Markov, but does **not** factorize: its support is a
set of eight configurations chosen so that every attempt to write `p` as a product over the
four edges forces a potential to vanish somewhere it must not. The example is *not* formalized
here, and deliberately so — it is a counterexample, not a reusable theorem, and stating it
would require pinning a concrete `V = Fin 4`, `α = Fin 2` model. Its role in this file is
documentary: it is the reason `hammersleyClifford` carries `hpos`, and the reason
`Undirected/Markov.pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov_of_nonempty` carries `IsGraphoid`
rather than `IsSemigraphoid`.

**Bibliographic comments.** The equivalence of the Markov property and factorization for
strictly positive distributions is the Hammersley–Clifford theorem: J. M. Hammersley and
P. E. Clifford, "Markov fields on finite graphs and lattices," 1971, unpublished; the first
published proofs are J. Besag, "Spatial interaction and the statistical analysis of lattice
systems," *J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B* **36** (1974), 192–236, and G. R. Grimmett, "A theorem
about random fields," *Bull. London Math. Soc.* **5** (1973), 81–84. The necessity of
positivity is J. Moussouris, "Gibbs and Markov random systems with constraints," *J. Statist.

Assembled from Mathlib's `SimpleGraph.IsClique` (which means *complete*, not maximal) by
filtering `Finset.univ : Finset (Finset V)`.

Edge behaviour: `∅` and every singleton are complete (`SimpleGraph.IsClique.of_subsingleton`),
so `completeSubsets G` always contains `∅` and all `{v}`; for the complete graph it is all of
`Finset.univ`, and for the empty graph it is `{∅} ∪ {{v} | v}`. -/

/-- A family of **clique potentials** for `G` (Lauritzen eq. (3.11), p. 34): for every complete
set `c`, the factor `ψ c` depends on the configuration only through the coordinates in `c`.

Edge behaviour: nothing is required of `ψ c` for a non-complete `c` — those factors never enter
the product in `FactorizesOver`. The potentials are `ℝ≥0∞`-valued and are *not* required to be
finite, positive, or normalised; Lauritzen's are non-negative measurable functions. -/

`p(x) = ∏_{c complete} ψ_c(x_c)` for some family of clique potentials.

*Book vs Lean.* This is (3.11), the product over **complete** subsets. Lauritzen's (3.12) is
the same property with the product taken over the maximal complete subsets ("cliques"); the two
are equivalent, since each potential may be absorbed into a maximal complete set containing its
index, and we state (3.11) because Mathlib's `IsClique` is completeness rather than maximality.

Edge behaviour: the empty set and all singletons are complete, so `FactorizesOver G p` always
permits a global constant and an arbitrary product of one-vertex factors; in particular every
`p` of the form `∏ v, f v (x v)` factorizes over the **empty** graph, and every `p` whatsoever
factorizes over the **complete** graph (take `ψ Finset.univ := p` and all other factors `1`),
which is the degenerate case in which (F) says nothing. -/

blocks cover `V`, then every complete set lies entirely inside `A ∪ S` or entirely inside
`B ∪ S`.

This is the only graph theory in the file. If a complete `c` met both `A ∖ S` and
`B ∖ S` at two distinct vertices they would be adjacent, and the one-edge walk between them has
support contained in `{a, b}`, which is disjoint from `S` — contradicting `hsep`; if it met
them at the *same* vertex, the `nil` walk at that vertex gives the same contradiction. The
cover hypothesis is what turns "`c` misses `A ∖ S`" into "`c ⊆ B ∪ S`". -/

/-- **Lauritzen Proposition 3.8**, p. 35: **(F) ⇒ (G)**. A mass function that factorizes over
`G` is globally Markov with respect to `G`.

Stated against the abstract `IsGlobalMarkov` of `Undirected/Markov.lean` instantiated at the
discrete relation `CondIndepMass p`, so that the rest of the hierarchy — (G) ⇒ (L) ⇒ (P),
Lauritzen Proposition 3.4 — is obtained by composition.

*No finiteness or positivity hypothesis.* Both halves of the argument are division-free — the
product split and the `mpr` half of the criterion (3.6) — and the final shrinking step, (C2),
is a pure sum rearrangement.

Given a disjoint separated triple `(A, B, S)`: enlarge `A` to `A'`, the union of `A`
with all connected components of `G` minus `S` that meet `A`, and set `B' := V ∖ (A' ∪ S)`.
Then `A ⊆ A'`, `B ⊆ B'`, the triple `(A', B', S)` is disjoint, covers `V`, and `S` still
separates `A'` from `B'`. Split the product there, feed it to the criterion (3.6) after
rewriting `p` as `blockMarginal (A' ∪ B' ∪ S) p`, and shrink `A' ↝ A`, `B' ↝ B` with (C2)
(using symmetry on the left-hand block). -/

/-! ### Theorem 3.9 — Hammersley–Clifford

The forward implication is Proposition 3.8 above composed with the hierarchy; the reverse is the
substantive half, and the proof is the classical Möbius inversion of `log p` over the subset
lattice (Besag 1974; Grimmett 1973; Lauritzen Appendix A.3): define the interaction terms
`φ_a(x) := ∑_{b ⊆ a} (−1)^{|a ∖ b|} log p(x_b, x*_{V ∖ b})` at a fixed reference configuration
`x*`, show by the pairwise Markov property that `φ_a ≡ 0` for every non-complete `a`, and read
off the factorization. Positivity is used twice: to take logarithms at all, and to run the
cancellation in the vanishing argument.

*Sign convention.* The scaffolding below writes the sign as `(−1)^{|a| + |b|}`, which for
`b ⊆ a` equals `(−1)^{|a ∖ b|}` but interacts far better with
`Finset.card_insert_of_notMem` — the lemma that drives the vanishing argument. -/

/-! #### The subset-lattice (Möbius) machinery

Everything in this block is private scaffolding for `hammersleyClifford`. The declarations are
stated over fresh type variables `W`, `β` wherever
they are pure combinatorics, so that none of the file's `Fintype`/`DecidableEq` section
variables leak into them. -/

/-- The alternating sum of `(-1)^{|t|}` over the subset lattice of `u`, in `ℝ`. This is the real
cast of Mathlib's `Finset.sum_powerset_neg_one_pow_card`; it is the only combinatorial input to

/-- **Möbius inversion over the subset lattice** — Lauritzen **Lemma A.2**, Appendix A.3. For any
`F : Finset W → ℝ`,
`∑_{a ⊆ s} ∑_{b ⊆ a} (-1)^{|a|+|b|} F b = F s`.

The inner sum is Lauritzen's interaction term `φ_a` (his eq. (3.14)); the identity says that
summing the interactions over all subsets of `s` recovers `F s`.

*Sign convention.* The exponent is `|a| + |b|` rather than the more familiar `|a ∖ b|`: for
`b ⊆ a` the two agree, and `|a| + |b|` behaves far better under `Finset.card_insert_of_notMem`,
which is what the vanishing argument below needs.

Exchange the two sums, after replacing the inner index set `a.powerset` by `s.powerset` guarded

*Real-valued, not `ℝ≥0∞`-valued, and deliberately so.* The Möbius sum below is **alternating**,
so it cannot live in `ℝ≥0∞`, which has no subtraction; and the multiplicative form of the

by hand at every step. Strict positivity (`hpos`) and finiteness (`hp`) make `(p ·).toReal`
strictly positive and finite, so `Real.log` is honest and the whole inversion runs in the

/-! #### The cross-ratio form of pairwise conditional independence -/

/-- **The cross-ratio identity.** For a strictly positive finite mass function, `X_i ⫫ X_j` given
all the remaining coordinates is equivalent to the vanishing of the `2 × 2` "interaction"
`p(s,t,r) · p(s',t',r) = p(s',t,r) · p(s,t',r)` — the four configurations differing only in the
`i`- and `j`-coordinates.

Here `y₀ = (s,t,r)`, `y₁ = (s',t,r)`, `y₂ = (s,t',r)`, `y₃ = (s',t',r)`.

Write `M := p_{V ∖ {i,j}}`, `A := p_{V ∖ {j}}`, `B := p_{V ∖ {i}}`. Lauritzen's identity
(3.2) at the blocks `{i}`, `{j}`, `V ∖ {i,j}` reads `p · M = A · B` (the joint block is all of
`V`), and `M` is common to all four configurations while `A` is common to `y₀, y₂` and to
`y₁, y₃`, and `B` to `y₀, y₁` and to `y₂, y₃`. Multiplying the four instances pairwise gives
the claim after cancelling `M²`, which is legitimate because `M` is nonzero and finite. -/

/-! #### Vanishing of the interaction terms at non-complete sets -/

/-- **The crux of Hammersley–Clifford**: the interaction term `φ_a` vanishes identically whenever
`a` is **not** complete — Lauritzen **Theorem 3.9**, p. 36.

Pick non-adjacent `i ≠ j` in `a` and write `a = insert i (insert j c)` with
`c = (a.erase i).erase j`. Splitting `a.powerset` twice regroups the alternating sum as
`∑_{b ⊆ c} ±(H_b − H_{b ∪ i} − H_{b ∪ j} + H_{b ∪ {i,j}})`,
and each bracket vanishes: the four configurations `x^b`, `x^{b ∪ i}`, `x^{b ∪ j}`,
`x^{b ∪ {i,j}}` differ only in the `i`- and `j`-coordinates, so the cross-ratio identity — fed
by the pairwise Markov property at `(i, j)` — makes their masses satisfy `p·p = p·p`, hence
their logarithms cancel. -/

/-- **The Hammersley–Clifford theorem** — Lauritzen **Theorem 3.9**, p. 36. For a *strictly
positive* mass function on a finite configuration space, the pairwise Markov property (P) and
the factorization property (F) are equivalent.

*Book vs Lean.* Lauritzen's hypotheses are that the density be **positive and continuous** with
respect to a product measure. Here the dominating product measure is counting measure on
`V → α`, and continuity is vacuous: Lauritzen himself notes on p. 28 that on a discrete space
every function is continuous. Positivity is `hpos`, and finiteness (`hp`) is the `ℝ≥0∞`-side
counterpart of "`f` is a density", needed so that the graphoid calculus
(`isGraphoid_condIndepMass_of_pos`) applies.

*Positivity is not removable.* Without it, (P) — indeed even (G) — fails to imply (F):
Lauritzen's **Example 3.10** (Moussouris, pp. 37–38); see the module docstring.

**Proof.** The `mp` direction is `factorizesOver_implies_pairwiseMarkov`.

The `mpr` direction is the Möbius inversion of `log p` over the subset lattice (Besag 1974;
Grimmett 1973; Lauritzen Appendix A.3). Fix a reference configuration `x✶` — legitimate because
`V → α` is either empty, in which case (F) is vacuous, or inhabited. Write `x^b` for the
configuration agreeing with `x` on `b` and with `x✶` off `b` (`hcSub`), set
`H_b(x) = log p(x^b)` (`hcH`) and let `φ_a` be the alternating sum of `H_b` over `b ⊆ a`
(`hcPhi`). Then:

* `sum_powerset_moebius` gives `∑_{a ⊆ V} φ_a(x) = H_V(x) = log p(x)`;
* `hcPhi_eq_zero_of_not_isClique` — the crux — gives `φ_a ≡ 0` for every non-complete `a`, by
  the cross-ratio form of the pairwise Markov property (`crossRatio_of_condIndepMass`);
* so `log p(x) = ∑_{c complete} φ_c(x)`, and exponentiating gives (F) with the clique potentials
  `ψ_c := exp ∘ φ_c`, whose `DependsOn` is `dependsOn_hcPhi`.

*Why `ℝ` and not `ℝ≥0∞`.* The Möbius sum is alternating, so it needs subtraction, and the
multiplicative form would need `ℝ≥0∞`-division with its junk values at `0` and `∞`. Positivity
and finiteness make `(p ·).toReal` a strictly positive real, so `Real.log` is faithful and the
whole inversion runs in `ℝ`; `ENNReal.ofReal ∘ Real.exp` converts back, and
`ENNReal.ofReal_prod_of_nonneg` turns the sum into the required product. This is the one place
in the area where the `ℝ≥0∞` mass algebra is deliberately left for `ℝ`.

*Positivity is used twice*, exactly as Lauritzen says: to take logarithms at all, and — through
`blockMarginal_ne_zero` — to cancel the conditioning marginal in the cross-ratio step. -/
