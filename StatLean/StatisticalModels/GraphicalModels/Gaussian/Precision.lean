# The concentration (precision) matrix and Lauritzen's Proposition 5.2

The bridge between the *algebra* of a regular multivariate normal law and the *conditional
independence* vocabulary of `Core.CondIndep`: conditional independence of two coordinates given
all the others is **exactly** a vanishing entry of the inverse covariance matrix.

* `precisionMatrix S := S⁻¹` — Lauritzen's concentration matrix `K = Σ⁻¹`;
* `principalSubmatrix S A` — Lauritzen's `Σ_A`, the principal submatrix on an index block;
* `posDef_submatrix_of_injective`, `posDef_of_fromBlocks_inl/inr` — the positive-definiteness
  plumbing that lets every block statement below derive its own nondegeneracy side conditions
  instead of assuming them;
* **`submatrix_precisionMatrix_fromBlocks_inr_inr` — Lauritzen (C.3)**: the concentration matrix
  of the conditional distribution is obtained from the joint concentration matrix by *deleting*
  the rows and columns of the conditioned-on variables, i.e. it is a principal submatrix of `K`;
  equivalently `condCovMatrix … = (K₂₂)⁻¹` (`condCovMatrix_eq_inv_submatrix_precisionMatrix`,
  the matrix form of Lauritzen (5.10)–(5.11));
* `submatrix_precisionMatrix_fromBlocks_inr_inl` — Lauritzen **(C.4)**, the companion identity
  `K₂₂⁻¹ K₂₁ = −Σ₂₁Σ₁₁⁻¹` consumed by `GraphicalModels.Gaussian.Regression`;
* `map_multivariateGaussian_fromBlocks_eq_prod_iff` — Lauritzen **Corollary C.6** in block form:
  two blocks of a regular joint Gaussian are independent iff the cross-covariance vanishes iff
  the cross-concentration vanishes;
* `gaussianCoords` — the coordinate random vector `(Y_γ)_{γ ∈ ι}` on `EuclideanSpace ℝ ι`, the
  carrier that lets `CondIndepCoords` speak about a Gaussian law;
* **`condIndepCoords_gaussianCoords_iff_blockPrecisionMatrix_eq_zero` (HEADLINE, Lauritzen
  Proposition 5.2 in block form)**: for `Σ` regular and **pairwise disjoint** blocks `A`, `B`,
  `C` with union `E`, `Y_A ⫫ Y_B ∣ Y_C ⟺ (K^E)_{AB} = 0`, where `K^E = (Σ_E)⁻¹` is the
  concentration matrix of the marginal law of `Y_E`. This is the form the graphoid axioms of
  `Gaussian.Model` consume, at a single `E = A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D` shared by premises and conclusion;
* **`condIndepCoords_gaussianCoords_iff_precisionMatrix_eq_zero` (Lauritzen
  Proposition 5.2, p. 129)**: for `Σ` regular and `γ ≠ μ`,
  `Y_γ ⫫ Y_μ ∣ Y_{Γ∖{γ,μ}} ⟺ k_{γμ} = 0` — the instance `A = {γ}`, `B = {μ}`, `C = Γ ∖ {γ, μ}`
  of the block form, where `E = Γ`.

**Reference.** S. L. Lauritzen, *Graphical Models*, Oxford Statistical Science Series 17,
Clarendon Press, Oxford, **1996 (first edition)**: §5.1.3 "Conditional independence", p. 129 —
Proposition 5.2 and the displays (5.10), (5.11); Appendix C, pp. 256–257 — Proposition C.5 with
(C.2) and the identities (C.3) `K₁₁⁻¹ = Σ₁₁ − Σ₁₂Σ₂₂⁻Σ₂₁` and (C.4) `K₁₁⁻¹K₁₂ = −Σ₁₂Σ₂₂⁻` on
p. 256, the determinant identity (C.5) and Corollary C.6 on p. 257
(`Lauritzen §5.1.3`, `Lauritzen App. C`). Page numbers and item kinds follow
`notes/factor_graphical/books.md`.

*Generalized versus ordinary inverse.* Lauritzen writes `Σ₂₂⁻`, "an arbitrary generalized
inverse", in (C.2)–(C.4), but his own proof of Proposition C.5 assumes `Σ` regular and then
`Σ₂₂⁻ = Σ₂₂⁻¹`. We state the regular case only, matching both his proof and the standing
hypothesis of §5.1.3; the pseudoinverse form is already a named future debt of the Gaussian
slice (D-G1 in `Gaussian/Conditioning`).

**Proof formalization notes.**

*Book vs Lean, orientation.* Lauritzen partitions `X = (X₁, X₂)` and conditions on the
**second** block (Proposition C.5 computes the law of `X₁` given `X₂`), so his (C.3) reads
`K₁₁⁻¹ = Σ₁₁ − Σ₁₂Σ₂₂⁻¹Σ₂₁`. The repo's Gaussian slice conditions on the **first** block:
`condCovMatrix S₁₁ S₁₂ S₂₂ = S₂₂ − S₁₂ᵀ S₁₁⁻¹ S₁₂` is the law of block `ι₂` given block `ι₁`
(`Gaussian.Conditioning`). Every book identity is therefore transcribed with the two blocks
swapped: (C.3) becomes `K₂₂ = (condCovMatrix …)⁻¹` and (C.4) becomes
`K₂₂⁻¹ K₂₁ = −condMeanMatrix …`. Nothing else changes.

*Book vs Lean, regularity.* Lauritzen says "`Σ` regular"; `Matrix.inv` is a junk-valued total
function (`0` at singular matrices) and `multivariateGaussian` degenerates to a Dirac mass off
the positive-semidefinite cone, so every statement below carries an explicit `PosDef`
hypothesis. `PosDef` rather than `PosSemidef`: an inverse is taken in every one of them.

*Route for the headline (Proposition 5.2, block form).* The analytic content is isolated in the
private `condIndep_blockProj_iff_precisionMatrix_eq_zero`, stated on a sum index
`κ_C ⊕ (κ_A ⊕ κ_B)` with the conditioning block first (because `compProd_gaussianCondKernel`
conditions on the first block); the two headlines are index transports of it. Transport `S` along
`blockSplit4` — the four-block split `(C ⊕ (A ⊕ B)) ⊕ Eᶜ ≃ Γ` built from subtype coercions, so
that the `coords` sub-vectors of `Core.Coordinates` are *definitionally* the transported blocks —
through `multivariateGaussian_map_reindex`, delete the `Eᶜ` block with
`multivariateGaussian_map_blockFst` (a Gaussian marginal is the principal submatrix: this is
where `Σ_E` comes from), and re-read the conditional independence on the marginalised law with
`Core.CondIndep.condIndep_congr_law`. Inside the core lemma:
1. `compProd_gaussianCondKernel` writes the law as `N(m_C, Σ_CC) ⊗ₘ gaussianCondKernel …`, whose
   conditional covariance `condCovMatrix Σ_CC Σ_{C,AB} Σ_{AB,AB}` does **not** depend on the
   conditioning value — this is what makes the disintegration a *product* kernel and hence
   `CondIndep`;
2. (C.3) above identifies that conditional covariance's inverse with the principal submatrix
   `K_{AB}` of the joint concentration matrix — Lauritzen (5.10);
3. `map_multivariateGaussian_fromBlocks_eq_prod_iff` (Corollary C.6) applied *inside* the
   conditional law splits it into a product over the two blocks iff its cross-covariance
   vanishes iff the cross-concentration does;
4. the `CondIndep` witnesses are the two block marginals of the conditional kernel
   (`Kernel.map` of `gaussianCondKernel` along the two projections), Markov by
   `Kernel.IsMarkovKernel.map`.
Lauritzen's own proof is exactly this ("almost a direct consequence of Proposition C.5 and its
proof", p. 129), so no shortcut is being taken.

*Law transfer.* Everything here is stated for the **canonical** coordinate vector
`gaussianCoords` on the Gaussian's own sample space `EuclideanSpace ℝ ι`. Transferring to an
arbitrary random vector `Y : Ω → ι → ℝ` whose law is `N(m, S)` needs the fact that `CondIndep`
depends only on the joint law of `(f, g, h)`; that is `Core.CondIndep.condIndep_congr_law`, and
the block form above uses it for exactly one purpose — to re-read a conditional independence of
`Y` on the *marginal* law of `Y_E`, which lives on a different sample space.

**Bibliographic comments.** The characterisation of conditional independence by zeros of the
inverse covariance is due to A. P. Dempster, "Covariance selection," *Biometrics* **28** (1972),
157–175, who introduced the term *covariance selection* for the resulting model class; the
matrix identities (C.3)–(C.5) are the classical Schur-complement calculus (I. Schur, 1917),
standard in multivariate analysis since T. W. Anderson, *An Introduction to Multivariate
Statistical Analysis*, Wiley, 1958, §2.5. The name *concentration matrix* is Dempster's;
*precision matrix* is the Bayesian synonym.

/-- **Lauritzen Corollary C.6** (p. 257) in the repo's measure-level form: two blocks of a
regular joint Gaussian are independent — the joint law transported to the product space is the
product of the block marginals — iff the cross-concentration block vanishes.

The `⟸` direction is `multivariateGaussian_fromBlocks_prod` (G2.9) after
`submatrix_precisionMatrix_fromBlocks_inl_inr_eq_zero_iff` turns `K₁₂ = 0` into `S₁₂ = 0`; the
`⟹` direction reads the covariance off the product law with `covMatrix_multivariateGaussian`
(the covariance of a product measure is block diagonal). -/

/-- **The analytic core of Proposition 5.2**, stated on a sum index with the conditioning block
first: for a regular Gaussian on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (κ_C ⊕ (κ_A ⊕ κ_B))`, the middle block is
conditionally independent of the last given the first **iff** the corresponding rectangle of the
concentration matrix vanishes.

Everything Lauritzen's proof of Proposition 5.2 does happens here, and only here; both the
pairwise Proposition 5.2 and its block form below are index transports of this statement.

*Route (Lauritzen's own: "almost a direct consequence of Proposition C.5 and its proof", p. 129).*
1. `compProd_gaussianCondKernel` writes the law as `N(m₁, T₁₁) ⊗ₘ gaussianCondKernel …`, whose
   conditional covariance `Q = condCovMatrix T₁₁ T₁₂ T₂₂` does **not** depend on the conditioning
   value — this is what makes the disintegration a *product* kernel and hence `CondIndep`;
2. (C.3) `submatrix_precisionMatrix_fromBlocks_inr_inr` identifies `Q⁻¹` with the principal
   submatrix of the joint concentration matrix on the conditioned block — Lauritzen (5.10);
3. `map_multivariateGaussian_fromBlocks_eq_prod_iff` (Corollary C.6) applied *inside* the
   conditional law splits it into a product over the two sub-blocks iff its cross-concentration
   vanishes;
4. the `CondIndep` witnesses are the two block marginals of the conditional kernel
   (`Kernel.map` of `gaussianCondKernel` along the two projections), Markov by
   `Kernel.IsMarkovKernel.map`; the `⟹` direction identifies the anonymous witnesses of
   `CondIndep` with them through `eq_condKernel_of_measure_eq_compProd`. -/

/-- **HEADLINE — Lauritzen Proposition 5.2 in block form** (*Graphical Models*, 1996, §5.1.3,
p. 129, at general blocks rather than a pair of coordinates).

Let `Y ∼ N_{|Γ|}(ξ, Σ)` with `Σ` regular and let `A`, `B`, `C` be **pairwise disjoint** blocks
with union `E`. Write `K^E = (Σ_E)⁻¹` for the concentration matrix of the principal submatrix on
`E` — equivalently of the marginal law of `Y_E`. Then

`Y_A ⫫ Y_B ∣ Y_C  ⟺  (K^E)_{AB} = 0`.

For `A = {γ}`, `B = {μ}`, `C = Γ ∖ {γ, μ}` this is `E = Γ` and the pairwise Proposition 5.2
(`condIndepCoords_gaussianCoords_iff_precisionMatrix_eq_zero`, derived from this below).

*Why `E` is a parameter with `hE : A ∪ B ∪ C = E` rather than the literal union.* The index type
`↥E` — and hence the *type* of `K^E` — depends on `E`, so two presentations of the same union
(`A ∪ (B ∪ D) ∪ C` and `A ∪ B ∪ (C ∪ D)`, say) would give propositionally equal but not
syntactically equal blocks and force a dependent transport at every use. Taking `E` as a
parameter lets the consumers of the graphoid axioms in `Gaussian.Model` fix **one** `E` and read
all their premises and conclusions on it, which is exactly what makes (C3) and (C5) bookkeeping.

*Route.* Marginalise, then apply the analytic core. `blockSplit4` transports `Σ` to the four-block
index `(C ⊕ (A ⊕ B)) ⊕ Eᶜ` (`multivariateGaussian_map_reindex`), `multivariateGaussian_map_blockFst`
deletes the `Eᶜ` block — the *marginal* of a Gaussian being the principal submatrix, which is
where `Σ_E` comes from — and `condIndep_congr_law` re-reads the conditional independence on the
marginalised law, the two triples having the same joint law by construction. The concentration
entries transport back along `Matrix.inv_submatrix_equiv`. -/

/-- **HEADLINE — Lauritzen Proposition 5.2** (*Graphical Models*, 1996, §5.1.3, p. 129).

Let `Y ∼ N_{|Γ|}(ξ, Σ)` with `Σ` regular, and let `K = {k_{αβ}} = Σ⁻¹` be its concentration
matrix. Then for two distinct coordinates `γ ≠ μ`,
`Y_γ ⫫ Y_μ ∣ Y_{Γ∖{γ,μ}}  ⟺  k_{γμ} = 0`.

This is the fundamental relation on which every model of Lauritzen ch. 5 rests: "Corresponding
to the different Markov properties studied in Chapter 3, we have multivariate normal models
defined through restricting particular elements in suitable concentration matrices to be equal
to zero" (p. 129).

The conditional independence is stated with the contracted `CondIndepCoords` of
`Core.Coordinates` for the canonical coordinate vector `gaussianCoords` on the Gaussian's own
sample space. The degenerate case `Γ = {γ, μ}` (empty conditioning block) is included and is
Corollary C.6.

The conditioning block is written `Finset.univ \ {i, j}` rather than `({i, j} : Finset ι)ᶜ` so
that this theorem lands **syntactically on the nose** of `Undirected.Markov.IsPairwiseMarkov`,
which is how `Gaussian.Model` consumes it.

*Route.* The instance `A = {γ}`, `B = {μ}`, `C = Γ ∖ {γ, μ}` of the block form above, whose
index block is then all of `Γ`; `Matrix.inv_submatrix_equiv` along `Equiv.subtypeUnivEquiv`
identifies `K^Γ` with `K`. -/
