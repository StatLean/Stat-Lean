# The undirected Markov properties — pairwise, local, global

Lauritzen's three Markov properties of a probability law relative to an undirected graph `G`,
stated over an **abstract** conditional-independence relation
`ci : Finset V → Finset V → Finset V → Prop` (read `ci A B C` as `X_A ⫫ X_B ∣ X_C`):

* `IsPairwiseMarkov G ci` — (P): non-adjacent `i`, `j` are independent given everything else;
* `IsLocalMarkov G ci` — (L): a vertex is independent of the rest given its neighbourhood;
* `IsGlobalMarkov G ci` — (G): separated blocks are independent given the separator.

and the hierarchy (Lauritzen **Proposition 3.4**, p. 32): (G) ⇒ (L) ⇒ (P), plus its converse
under (C5) (Lauritzen **Theorem 3.7**, Pearl and Paz, p. 34).

* `separates_neighborFinset`, `separates_sdiff_pair` — the two purely graph-theoretic facts
  that carry (G) ⇒ (L) and (G) ⇒ (P): the neighbourhood of `v` separates `{v}` from the rest,
  and the complement of a non-adjacent pair separates the pair;
* `notMem_neighborFinset_of_not_adj`, `disjoint_singleton_neighborFinset_of_not_adj`,
  `disjoint_closedNeighborhood_sdiff`, `disjoint_pairNeighborhood_sdiff` — the disjointness
  obligations that `IsSemigraphoid`'s axioms and `IsGlobalMarkov` demand of their blocks,
  isolated as named lemmas rather than buried in a proof;
* `sdiff_closedNeighborhood_eq_union_far`, `neighborFinset_union_far_eq_sdiff_pair` — the two
  set identities that make the weak-union instantiation land on the nose;
* `globalMarkov_implies_localMarkov`, `localMarkov_implies_pairwiseMarkov`,
  `globalMarkov_implies_pairwiseMarkov` — Proposition 3.4;
* `pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov_of_nonempty` — Theorem 3.7 (Pearl–Paz), proved by the
  book's downward induction on the separator;
* `markov_tfae_of_nonempty` — Theorem 3.7 as a cycle, each property read on nonempty blocks.
  The statements `pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov` and `markov_tfae`, which quantified over
  *all* disjoint triples, were **false** and have been **deleted**;
  `not_forall_pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov` and `not_forall_markov_tfae` are the
  machine-checked counterexamples, kept. The gap is the empty-block regime only —
  `IsGlobalMarkov` demands `ci ∅ ∅ ∅` of every instance (via `separates_empty_left`) whereas
  `IsPairwiseMarkov` says nothing about empty blocks, and every semi-graphoid axiom is a
  `ci → ci` implication, so the empty relation `ci ≡ False` is a graphoid satisfying (P) but not
  (G). Lauritzen's own blocks are nonempty, which is why the book is unaffected; a model class
  whose relation *does* hold at empty blocks (as the Gaussian's does) recovers the full
  `IsGlobalMarkov` by supplying those cases directly.

**Why an abstract `ci`.** This is the book's own observation. Lauritzen remarks immediately
after Proposition 3.4 (p. 33) that the implications (G) ⇒ (L) ⇒ (P) "only depend on the
properties (C1)–(C4) of conditional independence and hence hold for any semi-graphoid", and
the remark after Theorem 3.7 says the same of that theorem for graphoids. Abstracting
therefore proves the hierarchy **once**, with the discrete-mass relation, the Gaussian
precision relation, and our general `CondIndep` each supplying an instance.

**Reference.** S. L. Lauritzen, *Graphical Models*, Oxford Statistical Science Series 17,
Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1996: the properties (P), (L), (G) are the **unnumbered** labelled
definitions on p. 32 (there is no "Definition 3.x" to cite); **Proposition 3.4** (p. 32,
with eq. (3.9)) is (G) ⇒ (L) ⇒ (P); condition **(3.10)** (p. 34) is the intersection property
(C5); **Theorem 3.7** (p. 34), credited to Pearl and Paz, is the converse under (3.10). The
justification for the abstract relation is the remark following Proposition 3.4 (p. 33)
(`Lauritzen §3.2` in tags).

**Proof formalization notes.** *Book vs Lean, four deliberate differences.*

1. **Disjointness is carried by `IsGlobalMarkov`, not by its consumers.** Lauritzen states (G)
   "for any triple `(A, B, S)` of **disjoint** subsets of `V`". We put the three `Disjoint`
   hypotheses into the definition, matching the book and matching the amended
   `IsSemigraphoid`, whose axiom fields likewise range over disjoint blocks. This makes (G) a
   *weaker* assertion, hence easier for a model class to supply and harder to consume — and
   both consumers here instantiate it at genuinely disjoint blocks, so nothing is lost:
   `{v}`, `V ∖ cl(v)`, `ne(v)` are pairwise disjoint, and so are `{i}`, `{j}`, `V ∖ {i, j}`.
   (P) and (L) need no such hypothesis: their blocks are disjoint by construction.
2. **(G) ⇒ (P) is proved directly, not through (L).** Lauritzen's Proposition 3.4 routes
   (G) ⇒ (L) ⇒ (P), where the second step needs weak union. But `V ∖ {i, j}` separates `{i}`
   from `{j}` outright when `i` and `j` are non-adjacent (`separates_sdiff_pair`), so
   `globalMarkov_implies_pairwiseMarkov` needs **no** `IsSemigraphoid` hypothesis at all. We
   state it in that hypothesis-free form rather than as the composite, per the project's
   minimal-hypothesis rule; the composite route remains available via
   `localMarkov_implies_pairwiseMarkov ∘ globalMarkov_implies_localMarkov`.
3. **`ne(v)` and `cl(v)` are `Finset`s.** Lauritzen's `bd(α)` (boundary) is `G.neighborFinset
   v` and his `cl(α)` (closure) is `insert v (G.neighborFinset v)`; `V ∖ cl(α)` is
   `Finset.univ \ insert v (G.neighborFinset v)`. This needs `[Fintype V]` and
   `[DecidableRel G.Adj]`; the book works with a finite variable set throughout.
4. **The weak-union instantiation.** (L) ⇒ (P) applies (C3) at `A = {i}`, `B = {j}`,
   `C = ne(i)`, `D = V ∖ ({i, j} ∪ ne(i))`. The four blocks are pairwise disjoint — `i ≠ j`;
   `i ∉ ne(i)` because a `SimpleGraph` is loopless; `j ∉ ne(i)` is *exactly* the non-adjacency
   hypothesis of (P); and `D` excludes all three by construction — and `{j} ∪ D = V ∖ cl(i)`,
   `ne(i) ∪ D = V ∖ {i, j}`. The four obligations are the named lemmas listed above, so the
   set algebra stays visible instead of hidden inside one large proof.

**Bibliographic comments.** The three Markov properties and their hierarchy are due to the
Markov-random-field literature of the 1970s (Hammersley–Clifford 1971 unpublished;
J. Besag, "Spatial interaction and the statistical analysis of lattice systems," *J. Roy.
Statist. Soc. Ser. B* **36** (1974), 192–236; F. Speed and H. Kiiveri). The converse under the
intersection property is J. Pearl and A. Paz, "Graphoids: a graph-based logic for reasoning
about relevance relations," in *Advances in Artificial Intelligence II*, North-Holland, 1987,
357–363 — Lauritzen's Theorem 3.7. That (P) alone does **not** imply (G) without (C5) is
Lauritzen's Example 3.10 (pp. 37–38, Moussouris).

/-! ### The three Markov properties -/

/-- **(P) The pairwise Markov property** (Lauritzen p. 32, unnumbered): for every pair of
distinct non-adjacent vertices `i`, `j`, the relation holds for `{i}`, `{j}` conditionally on
all remaining vertices, `V ∖ {i, j}`.

*Edge behaviour.* The condition is vacuous on adjacent pairs and on `i = j`; the blocks
`{i}`, `{j}`, `V ∖ {i, j}` are pairwise disjoint whenever `i ≠ j`, so no disjointness
hypothesis is needed (contrast `IsGlobalMarkov`). Reading `ci A B C` as `X_A ⫫ X_B ∣ X_C`,
this is Lauritzen's `α ⫫ β ∣ V ∖ {α, β}`. -/
def IsPairwiseMarkov : Prop :=
  ∀ i j : V, i ≠ j → ¬ G.Adj i j → ci {i} {j} (Finset.univ \ {i, j})

/-- **(L) The local Markov property** (Lauritzen p. 32, unnumbered): every vertex `v` is
independent of the vertices outside its closure `cl(v) = {v} ∪ ne(v)`, conditionally on its
boundary `bd(v) = ne(v)`.

*Edge behaviour.* At an isolated vertex `ne(v) = ∅` this asserts unconditional independence of
`{v}` from `V ∖ {v}`; at a dominating vertex the "rest" block is empty and the condition is
whatever `ci A ∅ C` means for the instance — nothing here forces it to be trivially true. The
three blocks are pairwise disjoint by construction. -/
def IsLocalMarkov [DecidableRel G.Adj] : Prop :=
  ∀ v : V, ci {v} (Finset.univ \ insert v (G.neighborFinset v)) (G.neighborFinset v)

/-- **(G) The global Markov property** (Lauritzen p. 32, unnumbered): for every triple of
**disjoint** blocks `A`, `B`, `S` with `S` separating `A` from `B` in `G`, the relation holds
for `A`, `B` given `S`.

*Book vs Lean.* Lauritzen quantifies over disjoint triples, and so do we — the three
`Disjoint` hypotheses are part of the definition rather than of its consumers. This matches
the amended `IsSemigraphoid`, whose axiom fields also range over disjoint blocks, and keeps
(G) supplyable by model classes for which overlapping blocks would force degenerate
coordinates. *Edge behaviour.* Vacuously satisfiable content when `A` or `B` is empty is not
automatic: `Separates G S ∅ B` holds (`separates_empty_left`), so (G) demands `ci ∅ B S` of
every instance. -/

/-! ### Graph-side and set-algebra obligations

Everything in this section is graph theory or `Finset` algebra: no `ci` occurs. These are the
lemmas the hierarchy proofs need, kept named so the obligations stay visible. -/

/-- **The graph fact behind (G) ⇒ (P)**: for distinct non-adjacent `i`, `j`, the complement
`V ∖ {i, j}` separates `{i}` from `{j}`. A walk from `i` to `j` is non-`nil`; its second
vertex differs from `i` (looplessness) and from `j` (non-adjacency), so it lies in
`V ∖ {i, j}`. Stated outside the locally-finite section: no `[DecidableRel G.Adj]` is
involved, so `globalMarkov_implies_pairwiseMarkov` needs none either. -/

/-- **(L) ⇒ (P), with (L) used only where the "rest" block is nonempty** (Lauritzen
Proposition 3.4, p. 32, eq. (3.9)). The one step that needs the calculus: weak union (C3)
applied at `A = {i}`, `B = {j}`, `C = ne(i)`, `D = V ∖ ({i, j} ∪ ne(i))`, presenting the "rest"
block of (L) as `{j} ∪ D` and recognising `ne(i) ∪ D` as `V ∖ {i, j}`. The pairwise
disjointness that (C3) demands of its blocks comes from `i ≠ j`, from looplessness, and from
the non-adjacency of `i` and `j`.

The nonemptiness side condition on the hypothesis is **free at the point of use**: the rest
block `V ∖ cl(i)` is presented as `{j} ∪ D`, so it contains `j`. It is stated this way only so
that `markov_tfae_of_nonempty` — whose (L) is restricted to non-dominating vertices, the
empty-block regime being refuted by `not_forall_markov_tfae` — can use it;
`localMarkov_implies_pairwiseMarkov` is the corollary at the unrestricted (L). -/

/-! ### Theorem 3.7 (Pearl–Paz) — the converse under (C5)

The book's proof is a backward induction on `#(V ∖ (A ∪ B ∪ S))` that repeatedly applies (C5)
together with (C1)–(C4); it is the one place in this file where `IsGraphoid` rather than
`IsSemigraphoid` is required, and Lauritzen remarks (p. 34) that it "applies to any graphoid".

**The induction is carried out here in `pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov_of_nonempty`, which
is Theorem 3.7 restricted to nonempty `A` and `B`.** That restriction is not a shortcut: the
statement `pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov`, which quantifies over *all* disjoint
triples including empty blocks, is **false**, and
`not_forall_pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov` is a machine-checked counterexample. See that
declaration's docstring for the analysis; the short version is that `IsGlobalMarkov` demands
`ci ∅ ∅ ∅` of every instance (`separates_empty_left`) while `IsPairwiseMarkov` says nothing
whatever about empty blocks, and the semi-graphoid axioms cannot manufacture a first
`ci`-statement out of nothing. -/

/-- **(P) ⇒ (G) under the intersection property, on nonempty blocks** — Lauritzen
**Theorem 3.7** (p. 34), credited to Pearl and Paz; condition (3.10) of the book is exactly
`IsGraphoid.intersection`. This is the full mathematical content of Theorem 3.7; only the
degenerate empty-block regime, which the book excludes and which is genuinely unprovable
(`not_forall_pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov`), is missing relative to
`IsGlobalMarkov`.

**Proof.** Induction on `#(V ∖ S)`, i.e. downward induction on the separator, exactly as in the
book. Every step absorbs a nonempty block disjoint from `S` into the separator, so the measure
strictly drops. Four cases.

* `1 < #A`: pick `α ∈ A`. Then `S ∪ {α}` separates `A ∖ {α}` from `B` and `S ∪ (A ∖ {α})`
  separates `{α}` from `B` (both from the given separation, by monotonicity in the separator
  and in the separated block). The induction hypothesis gives
  `X_{A∖{α}} ⫫ X_B ∣ X_{S ∪ {α}}` and `X_{α} ⫫ X_B ∣ X_{S ∪ (A∖{α})}`; (C5) applied on the left
  factor `B` glues them to `X_B ⫫ X_A ∣ X_S`, and (C1) finishes.
* `1 < #B`: the mirror image, with (C5) applied directly (no (C1) needed).
* `A ∪ B ∪ S ≠ V`: pick `α` outside. Then `A ⫫ B ∣ S ∪ {α}` by induction, and **either**
  `S ∪ A` separates `{α}` from `B` **or** `S ∪ B` separates `{α}` from `A` — otherwise a walk
  from `A` to `α` avoiding `B ∪ S` concatenated with one from `α` to `B` avoiding `A ∪ S`
  would be an `S`-avoiding `A`–`B` walk (`Walk.reverse`, `Walk.append`,
  `Walk.mem_support_append_iff`). Either way (C5) then (C2) gives `A ⫫ B ∣ S`.
* otherwise `#A = #B = 1` and `A ∪ B ∪ S = V`, so `A = {a}`, `B = {b}`, `S = V ∖ {a, b}`, and
  `a`, `b` are non-adjacent (the one-edge walk `a–b` has support `[a, b]`, which misses `S`).
  This is (P) verbatim.

Note the empty-block regime cannot be patched by an extra case: it is the *base* of nothing —

/-- **The deleted `pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov` is false — machine-checked
counterexample.** Take `V = Fin 1`, `G = ⊥`, and the everywhere-false relation
`ci A B C := False`.

* `ci` is a **graphoid**: every field of `IsSemigraphoid`/`IsGraphoid` is an implication whose
  premises include a `ci`-statement, hence is vacuously true for the empty relation.
* `IsPairwiseMarkov ⊥ ci` **holds**: `Fin 1` is a subsingleton, so the hypothesis `i ≠ j` is
  never satisfiable and (P) is vacuous. (Any graph with no distinct non-adjacent pair works —
  a complete graph on any `V` does equally well.)
* `IsGlobalMarkov ⊥ ci` **fails**: `separates_empty_left` gives `Separates G ∅ ∅ ∅`, and the
  three `Disjoint` obligations are trivial at `∅`, so (G) demands `ci ∅ ∅ ∅`, i.e. `False`.

The obstruction is exactly the empty-block regime the module docstring already flags under
`IsGlobalMarkov`'s *edge behaviour*: (G) as stated asserts something at empty blocks, (P)
asserts nothing there, and no semi-graphoid axiom can produce a first `ci`-statement out of
nothing (all five are `ci → ci` implications). It is **not** a defect of the induction: the
whole of Lauritzen's Theorem 3.7 is proved above in
`pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov_of_nonempty`, and Lauritzen's own blocks are nonempty by
the standing convention of §3.2. Two ways to repair the statement: add
`A.Nonempty`/`B.Nonempty` to `IsGlobalMarkov` (matching the book), or make `IsGlobalMarkov`
demand nothing at empty blocks. -/

/-! ### Theorem 3.7 over *all* blocks — deleted, and why

There used to be two more declarations here:

```
theorem pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov (hci : IsGraphoid ci) (h : IsPairwiseMarkov G ci) :
    IsGlobalMarkov G ci

theorem markov_tfae [DecidableRel G.Adj] (hci : IsGraphoid ci) :
    [IsGlobalMarkov G ci, IsLocalMarkov G ci, IsPairwiseMarkov G ci].TFAE
```

**Both are false, and have been deleted.** The refutations are machine-checked and are kept
above:
`not_forall_pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov` and `not_forall_markov_tfae`, both witnessed by
`V = Fin 1`, `G = ⊥`, `ci ≡ False`.

*Where the gap is, and where it is not.* `IsGlobalMarkov` demands `ci ∅ ∅ ∅` of every instance
(`separates_empty_left` gives `Separates G ∅ ∅ ∅`, and the three `Disjoint` obligations are
trivial at `∅`), whereas `IsPairwiseMarkov` says nothing whatever about empty blocks and every
semi-graphoid axiom is a `ci → ci` implication — so the empty relation is a graphoid satisfying
(P) but not (G). The gap is **only** the empty-block regime: Lauritzen's own blocks are
nonempty, and the whole mathematical content of Theorem 3.7 is proved above in
`pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov_of_nonempty`. The two forward implications that
`markov_tfae` also contained, (G) ⇒ (L) and (L) ⇒ (P), are `globalMarkov_implies_localMarkov`
and `localMarkov_implies_pairwiseMarkov`, likewise proved above.

*The replacements.* `markov_tfae_of_nonempty` below is the cycle over the three properties each
read on nonempty blocks — no extra hypotheses. A model class that can also discharge the
degenerate blocks directly (the Gaussian can: see
`Core.Coordinates.CondIndepCoords.of_isEmpty_left`) gets the full `IsGlobalMarkov` by combining
that with `pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov_of_nonempty`. -/

/-- **The three Markov properties coincide over a graphoid, on nonempty blocks** — Lauritzen
**Theorem 3.7** (p. 34, Pearl and Paz), the repaired form of the deleted `markov_tfae`.

Each of the three properties is read on the blocks the book actually uses:

1. (G) on **nonempty** `A`, `B` — `IsGlobalMarkov` with `A.Nonempty`, `B.Nonempty` added, i.e.
   the conclusion of `pairwiseMarkov_implies_globalMarkov_of_nonempty`;
2. (L) at those vertices whose closure is not all of `V` — `IsLocalMarkov` with the "rest"
   block required nonempty;
3. (P) verbatim: its blocks `{i}`, `{j}` are nonempty by construction, so nothing is restricted.

The restriction in (1) and (2) is exactly the empty-block regime refuted by
`not_forall_markov_tfae`, and nothing more. Consumers holding the *unrestricted*
`IsGlobalMarkov`/`IsLocalMarkov` get (1)/(2) for free by dropping the extra hypothesis. -/
