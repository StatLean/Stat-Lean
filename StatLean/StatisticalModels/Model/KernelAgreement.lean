# Agreement of the model calculus with Mathlib's kernel algebra

Across the bridge `toKernel` / `⇑κ` of `Model.Defs`, the model-calculus operations of
`Calculus.Defs` are exactly Mathlib's kernel operations:

* `isMarkovKernel_toKernel_iff` — Markov ↔ pointwise probability;
* `observe_coe` — `observe ⇑K κ = ⇑(κ ∘ₖ K)` (observation is kernel composition);
* `pushforward_coe` — `pushforward ⇑K T = ⇑(K.map T)` (pushforward is kernel map);
* `condProd_coe_const` — the regression joint of a kernel model with a θ-free response
  kernel is Mathlib's kernel `compProd` with `prodMkLeft`-lifting;
* `measurable_observe`, `measurable_pushforward` — the operations preserve measurable
  parameterization (so bare families built by the calculus can re-enter kernel land).

Consequently every kernel-side result of the library (Mathlib's decision theory, the Bayesian
area, Minimaxity) transports to models built by the calculus, and conversely.

**Reference.** The kernel presentation of statistical models: L. Le Cam, *Asymptotic Methods
in Statistical Decision Theory*, Springer, 1986, Ch. 1 (verify §); TPE2 §1.1.

**Proof formalization notes.** All proofs are `funext`/`Kernel.ext` plus the defining `apply`
lemmas (`Kernel.comp_apply`, `Kernel.map_apply`, `Kernel.compProd_apply`). Measurability of
`observe P κ` for measurable `P` is free by rewriting through `observe_coe` at
`toKernel P hP` — no bespoke measurability inductions. The exact `⊗ₖ`/`prodMkLeft`
spelling of `condProd_coe_const` is pinned here.

**Bibliographic comments.** That parameterized families and transition kernels are the same
object (given measurability) is folklore of the kernel formulation of statistics; see
N. N. Chentsov, *Statistical Decision Rules and Optimal Inference* (Nauka, 1972) for the
early categorical treatment.
