# Competing risks — cause-specific hazards and cumulative incidence

Marked event-history observations `(T̃, κ) : ℝ × Option (Fin k)` — `none` = censored,
`some j` = failure from cause `j` (the `k = 1` case subsumes the `ℝ × Bool` censoring
carrier through `toBoolObs`):

* `causeSubLaw P j` — the cause-`j` sub-distribution `P(T̃ ∈ ·, κ = j)`; `cumIncidence` —
  the cumulative incidence function `F_j(t)`;
* `causeSpecificCumHazard P j` — cause-`j` event increments over the all-cause at-risk
  probability (`ABGK §IV.4`-style crude cause-specific hazard);
* **`sum_causeSpecificCumHazard` (S6.1)** — cause-specific hazards add up to the all-cause
  hazard;
* **`causeSubLaw_eq_withDensity` (S6.2)** — the exact CIF identity
  `F_j(dt) = S(t^-)\,Λ_j(dt)` in measure form;
* **`causeSpecificCumHazard_crLaw₂` (S6.3)** — for two *independent* latent cause times,
  the crude cause-specific hazard equals the net hazard of that cause where the other
  survives — the competing-risks mirror of the censoring headline (S2.3), positively
  resolving the identifiable region of Tsiatis's nonidentifiability;
* `graySubCumHazard` — Gray's subdistribution hazard, with its comparison to the
  cause-specific hazard.

`k`-cause crude=net and Aalen–Johansen/multistate are named future debts (D-S6, D-S1).

**Proof formalization notes.** All identities are `restrict`/`withDensity`/`map`
bookkeeping in the style of the closed `Censoring.lean` (whose `withDensity`-merge and
`0·∞ = 0` conventions are reused); S6.1 is countable additivity of `restrict` over the
disjoint cause slices; S6.3 replays the S2.3 density-merge with the roles of the two laws
symmetrized. Tie convention in `crObserve₂`: ties go to cause `0` (*Book vs Lean:* the
references assume no ties a.s.).

**Bibliographic comments.** Cause-specific hazards and their sum rule are classical
(Prentice et al. 1978); the CIF-vs-hazard identity is the competing-risks form of the
product-limit relation; the subdistribution hazard is Gray's (1988).
