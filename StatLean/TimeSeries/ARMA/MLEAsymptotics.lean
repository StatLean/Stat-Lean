# Hannan's theorem: asymptotic normality of the ARMA Gaussian MLE (FY Theorem 3.2)

The head of the commissioned Hannan program (ledger (a), batches C–D): for a
stationary causal invertible ARMA(p, q) with **iid** noise and coprime minimal orders,
any measurable approximate-MLE sequence over a compact identifiable region satisfies

`√T (θ̂_T − θ₀) →d N(0, W)`, `W = (hannanVarZBack b₀ a₀)⁻¹` (FY eq. (3.14)),

where `hannanVarZBack` is the covariance of the score vector `Z_t = (U_{t−1−i},
V_{t−1−j})` — see FINDING 26 at `hannanScore_brownInputs` and the orientation repair
recorded there (wave `ts/f1c-hannan-orientation`): the file used to write the *forward*
Gram `hannanVarZ` here, which is a different quadratic form as soon as `p, q ≥ 1` and
`max (p, q) ≥ 2`.

Stated in Cramér–Wold/charFun form, together with `σ̂² →p σ²`. FY's remarks are
honored: **no fourth moment is required**, and the noise assumption is exactly iid
(the martingale-difference weakening is future work, not stated).

**The whole of that head has been removed** — see **Removed** immediately below. What
this module still delivers is `hannan_sigma2_consistent` (`σ̂² →p σ²`), the `samplePACF`
definition, and the machine-checked falsity witness `ls_yw_mle_equivalent_debt_false`.
Everything from the *Assembly plan* paragraph onwards is kept verbatim as the historical
record of the route and its findings; read it as history, not as an inventory of what the
file contains.

**Removed (2026-08-10, user directive).** The three sorried declarations of this module,
the two headline theorems proved from them, and — transitively — the 41 `private`
declarations left with no surviving consumer, were deleted. This is by far the largest
deletion of the sweep: the entire `ScoreCLT` section (the score martingale, the three
Brown inputs and the averaged Lindeberg condition) went with it, because every path out of
it ran through one of the two headlines.

*Sorried (the three listed in the directive):*
* `armaMLE_linearization` — the Taylor/sandwich linearization of the approximate MLE
  against the score sum, the analytic core of FY Thm 3.2.
* `samplePACF_linearization` — the delta-method linearization of the sample PACF, with
  its variance normalisation `dᵀ W_k d = 1`.
* `ls_yw_mle_equivalent_debt` — B&D Thm 10.8.2 / FY §3.3.2: LS, Yule–Walker and Gaussian
  MLE for a causal AR(p) are `√T`-asymptotically equivalent (repaired two-conjunct form).

*Headline consumers:*
* `hannan_mle_clt` — **FY Theorem 3.2 (Hannan)**, Cramér–Wold/charFun form:
  `√T (θ̂_T − θ₀) →d N(0, W)` with `W = (hannanVarZBack b₀ a₀)⁻¹`. Proved from
  `armaMLE_linearization`.
* `samplePACF_clt` — **FY Proposition 3.1**: `√T π̂(k) →d N(0, 1)` for a causal AR(p) at
  lag `k > p`. Proved from `samplePACF_linearization`.

*`private`, proved, and left without a consumer* (all grep-verified; a survivor-reference
audit confirmed the cut is clean): the charFun bricks `charFun_map_eq_integral`,
`integrable_cexp_mul_I`, `norm_cexp_sub_cexp_le`, `tendsto_charFun_of_tendstoInProb_sub`;
the filtration/linear-process bricks `comap_le_sigmaLT'`, `sigmaLT_le'`,
`measurable_sigmaLT'`, `sigmaLT_mono'`, `arPoly_neg'`, `noRootClosedDisc_neg'`,
`exists_adapted_isLinearProcessOf`, `sum_range_shiftSeq_mul`, `isLinearProcessOf_comb`,
`isLinearProcessOf_unique`; the score apparatus `scoreSeq`, `scoreVec`,
`scoreVec_eq_comb`, `measurable_scoreVec`, `isLinearProcessOf_scoreVec`,
`integral_noise_sq`, `condExp_noise_mul_sq`, `hannanScore_condVar_lln`,
`memLp_noise_mul_of_adapted`, `memLp_scoreSeqS`; the Lindeberg apparatus `lindTrunc`,
`lindTrunc_nonneg`, `lindTrunc_le_sq`, `measurable_lindTrunc`, `lindTrunc_mul_le`,
`setIntegral_sq_eq_integral_lindTrunc`, `tendsto_integral_lindTrunc`,
`identDistrib_of_isStrictlyStationary`, `lindeberg_noise_mul`, `hannanScore_lindeberg`;
the Brown inputs and the score CLT `hannanScore_brownInputs_back`,
`hannanScore_brownInputs`, `hannanScore_clt`; and the PACF helpers `sum_padCoeff`,
`arPoly_pad`, `measurable_samplePACF`.

*Kept:* `hannan_sigma2_consistent` and its three `private` inputs
(`armaContrastVar_self`, `armaProfileS_atTruth_tendstoInProb`,
`armaProfileS_equicontinuous`), the two measure-splitting bricks, the `samplePACF`
definition, `measurable_inv_mulVec`/`measurable_sampleACVF`, and the whole
`ls_yw_mle_equivalent_debt_false` witness block with its white-noise instance.

Recover from `bdc8143f`.

The two items that used to be listed here alongside the above — FY Proposition 3.1 and
the LS = YW = MLE equivalence (B&D Thm 10.8.2), together with the reciprocal-variance
identity `(Γ_k⁻¹)_{kk} = σ⁻²` for `k > p` — are exactly what went.

**Assembly plan** (lane prompt carries detail): consistency (`mle_consistent`) +
score MDS (`armaScore_condexp_zero` + Brown `mds_clt_sequence`) + Hessian/information
LLN + the standard Taylor/sandwich argument on the profiled criterion.

**Status of the assembly** (wave `ts/d-hannan-assembly`). All three headline theorems
are *assembled*: their proofs run end to end over named `private` debts, which are
listed here with their exact blockers.

* Proved outright: the charFun bricks (`tendsto_charFun_of_tendstoInProb_sub`, the
  charFun form of Slutsky), `exists_adapted_isLinearProcessOf` (conditional expectation
  turns a linear process into an *adapted* one — `exists_isLinearProcessOf` alone does
  not, and Brown's CLT needs adaptedness), `hannanScore_clt` (the Brown CLT genuinely
  wired along the noise filtration), the padding lemmas and measurability of
  `samplePACF`, and the three assemblies.
* The **variance algebra** of the sandwich is carried out symbolically in the
  `ScoreCLT` section docstring; it collapses to `W⁻¹ = (hannanVarZBack b₀ a₀)⁻¹`.
* Debts (after wave `ts/f1c-hannan-orientation`, 2026-08-09): `armaMLE_linearization`,
  `samplePACF_linearization`. **`hannanScore_brownInputs` is CLOSED** (see below).
  **FINDING 26 (wave `ts/f1b-arma-deep`, 2026-08-09): `hannanVarZ` is the covariance of
  the FORWARD auxiliary vector, while the score contracts the BACKWARD one `Z_t =
  (U_{t−1−i}, V_{t−1−j})`; the two Grams read the AR–MA cross-block at opposite lags and
  differ whenever `p, q ≥ 1` and `max (p, q) ≥ 2`** (machine witness:
  `ScoreAnalysis.hannanVarZ_quadForm_ne_back`, at ARMA(2,1)).
  **ORIENTATION REPAIR APPLIED (wave `ts/f1c-hannan-orientation`, 2026-08-09).** Every
  statement in the chain that asserted a `hannanVarZ` covariance for the score now
  asserts the `hannanVarZBack` one: `hannanScore_brownInputs`(2), `hannanScore_clt`,
  `armaMLE_linearization`, `samplePACF_linearization`, and the headline
  `hannan_mle_clt`, whose asymptotic covariance is now `(hannanVarZBack b₀ a₀)⁻¹`.
  `hannanVarZ` itself is untouched (it is a correct object — the forward Gram — and
  `hannanVarZ_posDef` stands); what the repair supplies is its twin
  `ScoreAnalysis.hannanVarZBack_posDef`, proved by re-running the Bézout/degree argument
  at the score's shifts. The pure-AR and pure-MA instantiations are unaffected either way
  (`hannanVarZ_eq_back_of_pure_ar`, `..._of_pure_ma`).
  **`hannanScore_brownInputs` is now PROVED**: items (1) and (2) are
  `hannanScore_brownInputs_back`, item (3) is the new `hannanScore_lindeberg`.
  **CLOSED**: `armaProfileS_atTruth_tendstoInProb` (a two-line corollary of Consistency's
  now-public `armaProfileS_tendstoInProb`) and `armaProfileS_equicontinuous` (a one-line
  corollary of `Consistency.armaProfileS_locallyEquicontinuous`).
  `ARMA/Consistency.lean` is now `sorry`-free — `mle_consistent` is PROVED — and it
  exports the generic one-filter LLN `linearProcess_avgSq_tendstoInProb`, which is the
  analytic brick all three remaining debts were blocked on. Each of them now carries a
  status note naming exactly what is left; the short version is: an `L²`-limit
  past-measurability step (score `L²` and the conditional-variance identity), the
  `private` `hannanVec`/`hannanVarZ_quadForm` chain in `ARMA/ScoreAnalysis.lean` (a new
  scope blocker), an identical-distribution transfer for the Lindeberg input, and the
  Taylor/delta-method bookkeeping of the last two debts.
  The "**pointwise ergodic theorem**" diagnosis is **WITHDRAWN** (2026-08-08/09):
  `ARMA/Consistency.lean`'s `armaResidualSS_tendstoInProb` proved the pointwise LLN
  ergodic-theorem-free, and the *uniform* half is a deterministic θ-modulus estimate,
  not an ergodic statement — see `armaProfileS_equicontinuous` below, where the
  geometric-bound brick and the `ℓ¹` modulus of `π` are now available as
  `Consistency.exists_uniform_geometric_bound_arma` and
  `Consistency.exists_armaPi_l1_modulus`.
  The scope blocker that used to sit here — `ARMA/ScoreAnalysis.lean`'s
  `indep_noise_sigmaLT`, `private` and hence not citeable — is **gone**: wave
  `ts/s1b-arma-finish` made it public. (Its replacement, narrower, is the still-`private`
  `hannanVarZ_quadForm` chain; see `hannanScore_brownInputs`.)

**Two findings reported by this wave.**
1. `criterion_tendsto_contrast` is *strictly weaker* than the `S_T/T`-level LLN the
   variance part needs: `Real.log 0 = 0`, so at `σ² = 1` the degenerate event
   `{S_T = 0}` is invisible at the `log` level and the `exp`-transfer fails. The
   project-level fix is to un-`private` Consistency's `armaProfileS_tendstoInProb`.
2. The commissioned Bartlett route to `samplePACF_clt` is **closed**:
   `sampleACF_bartlett_clt_debt` carries `MemLp (ε 0) 4 μ`, which `samplePACF_clt` —
   correctly, FY Prop 3.1 needs two moments — does not assume. The martingale route
   taken instead is documented in the `PACF` section.

/-! ### The two inputs of the variance part

`S(θ̂_T)/T = (S(θ̂_T)/T − S(θ₀)/T) + S(θ₀)/T`: the second term is the quadratic-form
LLN at the truth, the first is killed by consistency plus a local equicontinuity
estimate. Both are recorded as named debts below; everything else is proved. -/

/-- At the truth the composite filter is `δ₀`, so the contrast variance is `1`. This is
the convolution identity `π(θ₀) ∗ ψ(θ₀) = δ` (`armaPi_conv_armaPsi`) read off term by
term; unlike `armaContrastVar_eq_one_iff` it needs no coprimality hypothesis. -/

/-- **The quadratic-form LLN at the truth**: `T⁻¹ xᵀ Γ_T(θ₀)⁻¹ x →p σ²`.

This is **not a second copy** of Consistency's debt: it is exactly that lane's
`armaProfileS_tendstoInProb` specialised to `θ = θ₀`, where the contrast variance is
`1` (`armaContrastVar_self`, above — the coprimality-free half of
`armaContrastVar_eq_one_iff`). The public `criterion_tendsto_contrast` is **strictly
weaker** than what is needed here: it controls `log(S_T/T) + T⁻¹ log det Γ_T`, and
`Real.log` is not injective at Lean's junk value (`Real.log 0 = 0`), so at `σ² = 1` the
degenerate event `{S_T = 0}` is invisible at the `log` level and the `exp`-transfer back
to `S_T/T` fails.

The lemma cited was `private` to `ARMA/Consistency.lean` when this debt was recorded;
the project-level fix that note asked for — making it public — has now been applied, so
this statement is a two-line corollary and no longer carries any debt of its own. -/

/-- **Local stochastic equicontinuity of the profiled sum of squares — PROVED**
(2026-08-09, wave `ts/s1b-arma-finish`): the oscillation of `θ ↦ T⁻¹ S_T(θ)` over a small
ball around `θ₀` is uniformly (in `T`) negligible in probability. It is a one-line
corollary of `Consistency.armaProfileS_locallyEquicontinuous`, where the estimate is
carried out; the note below is kept because two of its predictions were **overturned**
there (see the last paragraph).

Hannan's ergodic route proves this together with the pointwise LLN: `T⁻¹ S_T(θ)` is,
up to the `O(1/T)` edge effect controlled by `logdet_armaToeplitz_vanishes`'s
whitened-Toeplitz factorisation, the time average `T⁻¹ Σ_t r_t(θ)²` of the squared
`θ`-residual process, and `θ ↦ r_t(θ)` is Lipschitz in `θ` on the compact `K ⊆ 𝓑`
with an `L²`-integrable Lipschitz constant (geometric decay of `∂π_j/∂θ`, uniform on
`K` by `exists_geometric_bound_armaPi`). The claim that the missing ingredient is "the
pointwise ergodic theorem, absent from Mathlib" is **WITHDRAWN** (2026-08-08): the
pointwise LLN it is paired with is now reduced, in Consistency, to the single
ergodic-theorem-free item (C) (`armaProfileS_tendstoInProb`'s `hCLLN`), and the
finite-`T` half of the *oscillation* statement is not an ergodic statement at all — it
is the `θ`-Lipschitz estimate above, uniform in `T`, which needs a locally uniform
geometric bound on `π(θ)` and on `∂π(θ)` over the compact `K`.

**The brick itself is now PROVED** (2026-08-09, wave `ts/s1-arma-endgame`):
`Consistency.exists_uniform_geometric_bound_arma` (public) gives, for any compact
`K ⊆ 𝓑`, one `(C, r)` with `r < 1` bounding `|armaPi θ n|` *and* `|armaPsi θ n|` by
`C rⁿ` uniformly in `θ ∈ K`. Two amendments to the recipe recorded above:

* the Lipschitz-in-`z` step is **unnecessary**. Pushing the radius past `1` is done by
  the polar parametrisation `z = s · w` (`‖w‖ ≤ 1`, `s ∈ [1, 2]`): the zero set of
  `(θ, w, s) ↦ aeval (s·w) (maPoly θ.2)` is compact, so the minimum of its
  `s`-coordinate is already `> 1`. The rest is `IsCompact.exists_isMinOn` /
  `exists_isMaxOn` for `inf |den|` and `sup |num|` on `K × closedBall 0 R`;
* the diagnosis that `exists_geometric_bound_armaPsi` cannot be used as a black box was
  correct — its Cauchy estimate is redone carrying the radius and the sup-bound
  (`Consistency.abs_armaPsi_le_of_disc_bounds`, via `norm_cauchyPowerSeries_le` plus
  uniqueness of power series).

**No `∂π/∂θ` companion is needed.** What the oscillation estimate actually consumes is a
*modulus of continuity*, `∀ ε > 0, ∃ ρ > 0, ∀ θ θ' ∈ K, dist θ θ' < ρ →
∑' n, |π_n(θ) − π_n(θ')| < ε`, and that is free from the brick plus compactness of
`K × K`: it is PROVED as `Consistency.exists_armaPi_l1_modulus` (public).

**AMENDMENT (2026-08-09).** The Gram-tail *difference* modulus asked for below is **not
needed**, and the two "shortcuts" declared dead below are indeed dead but irrelevant.
What the oscillation estimate actually consumes is a bound on the correction term
`T⁻¹uᵀG_T(θ)u` that is `o_p(1)` *uniformly over `θ ∈ K`* — and that is available from the
entrywise bound `|G_{ij}| ≤ (1−r²)⁻¹h_ih_j`, which factorises the quadratic form into a
square of a **`θ`-free** envelope (`Consistency.quadForm_gramTail_le_env`). One Markov
inequality then covers the whole supremum at rate `O(1/T)`. The superseded plan follows.

**What was thought to be left here** was the matching modulus for the Gram tail. Writing
`Γ_T(θ)⁻¹ = Π_Tᵀ(1 + G_T)⁻¹Π_T` and splitting

  `[Π−Π′]ᵀ(1+G)⁻¹Π  +  Π′ᵀ[(1+G)⁻¹−(1+G′)⁻¹]Π  +  Π′ᵀ(1+G′)⁻¹[Π−Π′]`,

the outer two terms are handled by `exists_armaPi_l1_modulus`, `(1+G)⁻¹ ⪯ 1` and the
Schur test (`rowSum_kernel_le`); the middle term needs
`∑_j |G_T(θ)_{ij} − G_T(θ′)_{ij}| ≤ L(ρ)` uniformly in `T` and `i`, i.e.
`trace_gramTail_le`'s estimate redone in difference form off the same modulus. The two
apparent shortcuts do not work: the pathwise bound `T⁻¹uᵀG u ≤ K P² · T⁻¹‖x‖²` is
`O_p(1)`, not `o_p(1)`, and using `(1+K)⁻¹ ⪯ (1+G)⁻¹` in the sandwich costs an additive
`O(1)` term `log(1+K)` in the criterion. -/

/-! ### The frozen `ls_yw_mle_equivalent_debt` statement is FALSE — a formalized witness

Found in wave `ts/s12-model-selection` (2026-08-09). The statement quantifies over an
**arbitrary measurable** `bMLE`: no hypothesis ties it to the Gaussian likelihood, to
least squares, or to the data at all (and no least-squares estimator appears anywhere,
despite the name). It therefore asserts `√T · dist(b̂_YW, bMLE) →p 0` for *every*
measurable sequence `bMLE`, which fails for the constant translate
`bMLE := b̂_YW + 1` as soon as `p ≥ 1`.

The witness below is axiom-clean: the instance is the causal AR(1) with zero coefficient
(`b(z) = 1`, so `X = ε`) driven by the coordinate white noise on `(ℤ → ℝ, ⊗ N(0,1))`,
and `bMLE` is the translate, whose measurability comes from `measurable_inv_mulVec` /
`measurable_sampleACVF` above.

**Repair.** B&D Thm 10.8.2 compares three *estimators*, so `bMLE` (and a least-squares
sequence `bLS`, currently absent) must carry their defining hypotheses — for `bMLE` the
`hargmin`/`hδTfast` pair of `hannan_mle_clt`, for `bLS` the normal equations. With those
in place the statement becomes a genuine `√T`-equivalence and the residue is the one
recorded at `armaMLE_linearization`.

**The repair is applied** to `ls_yw_mle_equivalent_debt` below (wave
`ts/s12b-model-repairs`, 2026-08-09); see the Statement-strengthening paragraph there.
This witness is kept verbatim, quantified over the *frozen* shape `H`, as the permanent
record. -/
