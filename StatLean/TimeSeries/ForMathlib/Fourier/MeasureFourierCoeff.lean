# Fourier coefficients of finite measures on the circle `AddCircle (2π)`

For a finite measure `F` on `AddCircle (2π)` we define
`measureFourierCoeff F n = ∫ e^{inz} dF(z)` — with Mathlib's `fourier n` at `T = 2π`
being exactly `z ↦ e^{inz}`, so the book's transform convention
`γ(τ) = ∫_{−π}^{π} e^{iτω} dF(ω)` (FY eqs. (2.33)–(2.35), no `2π` factor in the forward
transform) is `measureFourierCoeff F τ` verbatim.

Bricks stated here:

* mass and norm bounds (`measureFourierCoeff_zero`, `norm_measureFourierCoeff_le`);
* **uniqueness**: a finite measure on the circle is determined by its Fourier
  coefficients (`ext_of_measureFourierCoeff`) — the uniqueness half that FY Theorem 2.10
  leaves unstated; via Stone–Weierstrass density of trigonometric polynomials
  (`span_fourier_closure_eq_top`);
* **weak-convergence of coefficients**: coefficients pass to weak limits of probability
  measures (`tendsto_measureFourierCoeff_of_tendsto`) — the Helly–Bray step of FY §2.7.4;
* negation invariance (`NegInvariant`) and its coefficient symmetry — the "symmetric
  distribution" bookkeeping of FY Theorem 2.10.

**Reference.** J. Fan and Q. Yao, *Nonlinear Time Series*, Springer, 2003, §2.3.1–§2.3.2
(eqs. (2.33)–(2.35)) and §2.7.4 (pp. 80–81). (`FY §2.3.2 Thm 2.10; §2.7.4`.)

**Proof formalization notes.** The interval `[−π, π]` with endpoints identified *is*
`AddCircle (2π)`; atoms at `±π` (a real possibility for spectral distributions, e.g.
white-noise-with-period-2 components) are handled by the circle picture with no endpoint
conventions. Uniqueness reduces to equality of the integrals of all continuous functions
(Riesz-type argument via density of `span (fourier '' univ)` in `C(AddCircle (2π), ℂ)`).

**Bibliographic comments.** That trigonometric moments determine a measure on the circle
is classical (Herglotz 1911, F. Riesz); the weak-convergence step is the Helly–Bray
theorem (E. Helly 1912; H. E. Bray 1919).
