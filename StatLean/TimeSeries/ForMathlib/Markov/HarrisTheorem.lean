# Harris' ergodic theorem, Hairer–Mattingly form

The elementary route to geometric ergodicity of a Markov kernel: **Lyapunov drift plus
minorization on a level set imply a contraction in a weighted total-variation
distance**, hence a unique invariant law approached at a geometric rate.

* `lyapDist β V μ ν = ∫ (1 + β V) d|μ − ν|` — the weighted TV distance (`weightedTV`
  below; the `β = 0` case is `2·tvDist`);
* `HasLyapunovDrift κ V γ K` — `P V ≤ γ V + K` pointwise with `γ < 1`;
* `HasMinorization κ S α` — `κ x ≥ α · ρ` on the level set `S` for a common probability
  measure `ρ`;
* `harris_contraction` — the Hairer–Mattingly estimate: for suitable `β`, `κ` contracts
  `lyapDist` by a factor `ᾱ < 1`;
* `harris_theorem` — the packaged conclusion: a unique invariant probability measure
  `π`, with `tvDist (κⁿ x) π ≤ C(x)·ρ̄ⁿ` — exactly the envelope `IsErgodicWithRate`
  (and hence `IsGeometricallyErgodic`) needs;
* `IsGeometricallyErgodic.of_pow` — the glue that lifts geometric ergodicity of the
  `p`-step kernel `κ^p` back to `κ` (needed because the minorization for the nonlinear
  AR kernel of FY Theorem 2.4 only holds after `p` steps, once every coordinate has
  been refreshed).

This file exists to discharge the last structural debt of the TimeSeries area,
`nlARKernel_geometricallyErgodic` (FY Theorem 2.4(ii)); the Meyn–Tweedie
ψ-irreducibility/petite-set apparatus is deliberately avoided. **That debt is now closed
here**, in the `NLAR` section at the foot of the file:

* `HasLyapunovDrift.pow` — the drift iterates: `κ^n` drifts with `γⁿ` and `K/(1−γ)`;
* `hasLyapunovDrift_nlAR` — the geometrically weighted sup-norm `V(𝐱) = ⨆ᵢ θⁱ|xᵢ|` is a
  Lyapunov function for the nonlinear-AR kernel, with `θ = λ^{1/(p+1)}`;
* `pow_ge_window` / `hasMinorization_nlAR_pow` — after `p+1` steps every coordinate has
  been refreshed, so the law is a fixed multiple of a *state-independent* window measure;
* `nlARKernel_geometricallyErgodic` — **FY Theorem 2.4(ii)**, assembled from the above by
  `harris_theorem` on `κ^{p+1}`, `eq_of_invariant_of_isErgodicKernel` (to move invariance
  back to `κ`) and `IsGeometricallyErgodic.of_pow`.

The statement of FY Theorem 2.4(ii) used to live in `GeometricErgodicity.lean` as a named
`sorry`; it had to move here because its proof consumes this file's engine while this file
imports that one. Nothing outside its own file referenced it.

**STATUS.** All five headline results are proved and axiom-clean. Three features of the
formalization are worth flagging, because each replaces a step of the textbook argument:

* **No coupling.** Hairer–Mattingly close the contraction with a coupling construction.
  Here the same estimate falls out of the *minimality* of the Jordan decomposition,
  `jPos_add_le_of_add_eq`: from `μ + B = ν + A` with a common piece `m ≤ A`, `m ≤ B` one
  gets `jPos μ ν + m ≤ A` directly, and taking `m = α·min(aL, bL)·ρ` subtracts the
  minorization mass from both halves at once. The scalar core, `harris_num`, needs no
  finiteness at all — every step is monotone in `ℝ≥0∞`, so the estimate is true verbatim
  when the weighted distance is infinite.
* **No completeness argument.** The invariant law is built *explicitly* rather than as the
  limit of a TV-Cauchy sequence: writing `a n`, `b n` for the one-step Jordan parts of the
  chain from a fixed `x₀`, the identity `μ n + b n = μ (n+1) + a n` telescopes to
  `μ N + Σ_{n<N} a n = μ 0 + Σ_{n<N} b n`, both series converge geometrically (their masses
  are exactly what the contraction bounds), and `π := (μ 0 + Σ b) − Σ a` is the limit —
  with the *tails* of the two series as the explicit total-variation error.
* **No change of variables, no Jacobian.** The `p+1`-step minorization is usually written
  with the density `∏ₖ g(y_k − m_k(𝐱, y_{<k}))` of the triangular value map. Here that
  density is never formed: the chain is rewritten *in value coordinates* once
  (`nlAR_lintegral`, a one-dimensional translation of Lebesgue measure), and the induction
  `pow_ge_window` peels one value at a time, so the only product structure needed is
  `Measure.pi` over `Fin (p+1)` reassociated by `Fin.cons` (`map_iterPush_succ`). The
  minorizing law is then *defined* as the pushforward of the window measure, so it needs no
  identification with Lebesgue measure on a cube — only the fact that it does not depend on
  the starting state, which `iterPush_congr` proves from index arithmetic alone.

The two definitions this file rests on were each *refuted* in an earlier pass and have
since been repaired:

* `weightedTV` used to be built from `Measure.singularPart` rather than from the Jordan
  decomposition of `μ − ν`, so it ignored every absolutely-continuous overlap of the two
  laws and did not even separate measures; `harris_contraction` was false against it.
* `HasLyapunovDrift.drift` used to be stated with the *Bochner* integral, which Mathlib
  sets to `0` on non-integrable functions, so the drift hypothesis said nothing at states
  where `∫⁻ V d(κ x) = ∞`; a chain could escape to infinity, and `harris_theorem` was
  false against it.

Both machine-checked counterexamples are **retained below as block comments** (search for
`REFUTATION`). They no longer type-check — that is the point: each was a witness against a
definition that no longer exists, and against the repaired definitions the very same data
is harmless (for the first witness the honest `|μ − ν|` weighting drops from `1 + 10β` to
`1 + 5.5β` in one step; for the second the `∫⁻` drift simply fails at every nonzero state).
They are kept verbatim, demoted to comments, because they are the record of *why* the
definitions read the way they now do.

Note that the uniqueness proof here does **not** go through any contraction: it splits
`π − π'` by a Hahn set, shows each half is separately `κ`-invariant, and then uses the
drift (through `level_set_pos`) and the minorization to make the minorizing measure
vanish. So the downstream consumers that only need uniqueness are unaffected.

`weightedTV` integrates against `|μ − ν| = jPos μ ν + jPos ν μ`, where `jPos μ ν` is the
positive part. Everything the contraction proof needs about `jPos` is here: it is the
`μ`-part where `μ` dominates (`jPos_le_left`), the two parts are exchanged by the identity
`μ + jPos ν μ = ν + jPos μ ν` (`add_jPos_comm`), and — the only nontrivial fact — that
identity is *minimal*: any other pair of measures realizing the same difference dominates
the Jordan parts, even after a common piece is removed (`jPos_add_le_of_add_eq`). That
minimality is what replaces Hairer–Mattingly's coupling step. -/

-- ## REFUTATION of `harris_contraction` against the *old* `weightedTV` (historical record)
--
-- Everything from here to the end of the `cNoContraction` block is **demoted to a comment**:
-- it was a machine-checked refutation of `harris_contraction` as stated against the previous,
-- `singularPart`-based `weightedTV`, and it no longer type-checks against the repaired
-- definition — which is exactly the outcome one wants.  Re-run on the repaired `weightedTV`
-- the same data is no longer a counterexample: `|μ − ν|` is `½δ₀ + ½δ₁`, so the distance is
-- `1 + 10β`, and after one step `|δ₂ − (½δ₀+½δ₂)| = ½δ₀ + ½δ₂` gives `1 + 5.5β < 1 + 10β`.
-- The analysis is kept because it is the reason the definition reads the way it now does.
--
-- `weightedTV` used to be built from `Measure.singularPart`, **not** from the Jordan decomposition
-- of the signed difference `μ − ν`: it sees only the parts of `μ` and `ν` that are *mutually
-- singular*, and drops every absolutely-continuous overlap.  (In particular `weightedTV β V μ ν
-- = 0` whenever `μ ≪ ν ≪ μ` with `μ ≠ ν`, so it does not separate measures.)  That makes the
-- frozen contraction statement false: mixing an `ε` of one law into the other can annihilate an
-- arbitrarily large share of the right-hand side while leaving the left-hand side untouched.
--
-- The witness below lives on `ℕ` with `V = (0, 20, 11, 11, …)`, `γ = 1/2`, `K = 1`, `R = 10`
-- (so `2K/(1−γ) = 4 < 10`), `α = 1`, `ρ = δ₀`, and the deterministic kernel `1 ↦ 2`, `n ↦ 0`
-- otherwise.  For `μ = δ₁` and `ν = ½δ₀ + ½δ₁`:
--   * `μ` is `ν`-absolutely continuous, so `singularPart μ ν = 0` and `weightedTV β V μ ν
--     = ∫(1+βV) d(½δ₀) = ½`;
--   * one step sends `μ ↦ δ₂` and `ν ↦ ½δ₀ + ½δ₂`, the *same* configuration, so the pushed
--     distance is again `½`.
-- Hence `½ ≤ ᾱ · ½` for every admissible `β`, forcing `1 ≤ ᾱ` — no `ᾱ < 1` can work.
-- `cNoContraction (harris_contraction cDrift cMinorize cHR)` has type `False` (checked).
--
-- The defect is *only* about `weightedTV`: every kernel below is a Dirac, so `V` is integrable
-- at every step and the Bochner/`∫⁻` forms of the drift agree.  The counterexample therefore
-- survives the drift repair described before `harris_theorem`.
--
-- The repair is to define `weightedTV` from the Jordan decomposition of `μ − ν` (equivalently,
-- from a Hahn set for the pair), which is what Hairer–Mattingly's `ρ_β` actually is.  With that
-- definition the contraction *is* provable without any coupling step: writing `μ − ν = a − b`
-- with `a ⊥ b` and `a S = b S = c`, one subtracts the common minorization mass
-- `m = α·min(a L, b L)·ρ` from both `a.bind κ` and `b.bind κ` (Jordan minimality gives
-- `a₁ ≤ a.bind κ − m`, `b₁ ≤ b.bind κ − m`), and the drift plus Markov's inequality
-- `a Lᶜ ≤ (∫V da)/R` close the estimate with
-- `ᾱ = max (1 + βK − α) (γ + 2α/(βR))` for any `2α/(R(1−γ)) < β < α/K`; such a `β` exists
-- exactly when `2K/(1−γ) < R`, i.e. under `hR`.  (The equal masses `a S = b S` are what the
-- `singularPart` version lacks, and are the whole reason the frozen version fails.)

-- ## REFUTATION of `harris_theorem` against the *old* Bochner drift (historical record)
--
-- As with the block above, everything down to the end of `tNoErgodic` is **demoted to a
-- comment**: it refuted `harris_theorem` as stated against the previous, Bochner-integral
-- form of `HasLyapunovDrift.drift`, and `tDrift` no longer type-checks — because with the
-- `∫⁻` drift the witness kernel simply *fails* the hypothesis at every nonzero state
-- (`∫⁻ V dν = ∞ > ofReal (γ V x + K)`), which is precisely the repair.  The chain itself is
-- still genuinely non-ergodic; it is only the drift hypothesis that it no longer satisfies.
--
-- `HasLyapunovDrift.drift` used to be stated with the **Bochner** integral `∫ y, V y ∂(κ x)`, which
-- Mathlib defines to be `0` when the integrand is not integrable (`integral_undef`).  Since
-- `V ≥ 0` and `γ V x + K ≥ 0`, the drift hypothesis is therefore **vacuous at every state `x`
-- where `∫⁻ V d(κ x) = ∞`** — it constrains nothing there.  A chain may then leave the level set
-- forever, and both existence *and* uniqueness of an attracting law fail.
--
-- The witness below lives on `ℕ` with `V 0 = 0`, `V n = 4ⁿ` (`n ≥ 1`), `γ = 1/2`, `K = 0`,
-- `R = 1` (so `2K/(1−γ) = 0 < 1`), `α = 1`, `ρ = δ₀`, and the kernel `0 ↦ δ₀`, `n ↦ ν`
-- (`n ≥ 1`) for the heavy-tailed law `ν = Σⱼ 2^{-(j+1)} δ_{j+1}`, which satisfies
-- `∫⁻ V dν = Σⱼ 2^{j+1} = ∞`.  The level set is `{0}`, where the minorization is exact; the
-- drift holds genuinely at `0` and vacuously everywhere else.  But `κⁿ(0,·) = δ₀` and
-- `κⁿ(1,·) = ν` for all `n ≥ 1`, and `δ₀ ≠ ν`, so no single law attracts every state:
-- `tNoErgodic (harris_theorem tDrift tMinorize tHR)` has type `False` (checked).
--
-- The repair is at the level of `HasLyapunovDrift`: state the drift as
-- `∫⁻ y, ENNReal.ofReal (V y) ∂(κ x) ≤ ENNReal.ofReal (γ * V x + K)` (or add `∀ x, Integrable V
-- (κ x)`).  `harris_invariant_unique` above is unaffected: its `Integrable V π` hypotheses buy
-- exactly the `π`-a.e. `∫⁻` form of the drift, which is what `drift_lintegral_ae` extracts.

/-! ### From the contraction to the invariant law

The limit is built **explicitly**, with no completeness argument: the Jordan identity
`μ n + b n = μ (n+1) + a n` for the chain `μ n = κⁿ(x₀,·)` telescopes to
`μ N + Σ_{n<N} a n = μ 0 + Σ_{n<N} b n`, the two series of nonnegative measures converge
geometrically (their masses are bounded by the contraction), and
`π := (μ 0 + Σ b) − Σ a` is the limit, with the tails of the two series as the explicit
total-variation error. -/

/-- **FY Theorem 2.4(ii)** — the drift/contraction criterion for the vectorized nonlinear
autoregression `X_t = f(X_{t−1}, …, X_{t−p−1}) + ε_t`. If the autoregression function is a
sup-norm contraction up to a constant, `|f(𝐱)| ≤ λ‖𝐱‖_∞ + c` with `λ < 1`, and the noise
has an everywhere-positive **continuous** density and a finite first moment, then the chain
is geometrically ergodic toward a (unique) stationary probability law.

This is the statement that used to sit in `GeometricErgodicity.lean` as a named `sorry`; it
moved here because its proof consumes this file's Harris engine, and this file imports that
one. It is the last structural debt of the TimeSeries area.

**Proof.** `V(𝐱) := ⨆ᵢ θⁱ|xᵢ|` with `θ := λ'^{1/(p+1)}`, `λ' := max λ ½` (the boost keeps
`θ > 0` when `λ = 0`), is a Lyapunov function: the shifted coordinates each gain a factor
`θ`, and the new coordinate `f(𝐱) + ε` costs `λ·θ^{−p} ≤ θ`, so
`E V(next) ≤ θ V + (c + E|ε|)` (`hasLyapunovDrift_nlAR`). After `p+1` steps every
coordinate has been refreshed and the state no longer depends on where it started
(`iterPush_full`), so `κ^{p+1}(𝐱, ·)` dominates `δ^{p+1}` times a *fixed* window measure —
Lebesgue measure on a cube, pushed through the (bijective, triangular) value map — where
`δ > 0` is the minimum of the density over a compact window (`hasMinorization_nlAR_pow`).
`harris_theorem` on `κ^{p+1}` then supplies the invariant law and the geometric rate;
`eq_of_invariant_of_isErgodicKernel` transports invariance from `κ^{p+1}` back to `κ`, and
`IsGeometricallyErgodic.of_pow` finishes. Petite sets and ψ-irreducibility are avoided
throughout — that is exactly what the continuity strengthening buys.

**Statement strengthening (documented).** FY assume only that `ε_t` has a positive density.
We additionally assume that density **continuous** (`hgc`): without it the density has no
positive lower bound on a compact window (`{g ≥ 1/n}` may have measure zero on every
interval for every fixed `n` only up to null sets, and the natural repair — restricting the
*noise* rather than the *value* — makes the `p+1`-step window law depend on the starting
state, which destroys the minorization). Every consumer of this theorem in the project
already supplies continuity: `Threshold/TAR.lean`'s `exists_stationary_tar` and
`exists_stationary_toy_setar` both hypothesize `∃ g, Continuous g ∧ (∀ x, 0 < g x) ∧ …`.
The mean-zero hypothesis `hmean` is not needed by the proof and is kept only because it is
part of the frozen FY statement. -/
