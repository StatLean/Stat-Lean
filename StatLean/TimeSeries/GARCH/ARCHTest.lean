# Testing for the ARCH effect (FY §4.2.6, eqs. (4.48)–(4.54))

`H₀ : b₁ = ⋯ = b_p = 0` (no ARCH effect) against `H₁` at least one `b_j > 0`, inside
the ARCH(p) family with iid noise. FY's key structural observation: **under `H₀` the
observations are iid**, so the three classical statistics have iid-likelihood
asymptotics and each has a `χ²_p` null limit.

* `archNullIsIID` — the structural fact that `H₀` collapses the ARCH model to iid
  scaled noise *(the printed setup (4.48)–(4.49) has two index/sign slips — "`a_j ≥ 0`"
  for `b_j ≥ 0`, and `b_j X_{t−i}²` for `b_j X_{t−j}²`; corrected here)*;
* `archLRStat` (**eq. (4.50)**), `archScoreStat` (**eq. (4.52)**), `archWaldStat`
  (**eq. (4.54)**) and Engle's `archTR2Stat` (**eq. (4.53)**), the auxiliary-regression
  form asymptotically equivalent to the score test for normal errors;
* the **Fisher information** (eq. (4.51)) of the ARCH likelihood at the null, and the
  three `χ²_p` limit statements. The intended route is to reuse the in-repo iid
  likelihood trinity, `StatLean/HypothesisTesting/LikelihoodMethods/
  TrinityChiSquared.lean`; where the wiring does not fit the ARCH parametrization the
  limits stay as named debts.

**Boundary caveat (documented, not formalized).** The alternative constrains
`b_j ≥ 0`, so under `H₀` the parameter sits on the boundary of the admissible set and
the `χ²_p` approximation is *not* valid for the constrained versions of these tests;
FY notes this and cites the one-sided-testing literature. Our statements are for the
**unconstrained** parametrization, where the classical limits do hold.

## The three `χ²_p` debts: why the in-repo trinity does not discharge them

`IsARCH.iid_of_b_eq_zero` is proved, so the structural input FY relies on is available.
The intended follow-up — instantiating `logLR_tendsto_chiSquared_affine` (and its score /
Wald companions) of `HypothesisTesting/LikelihoodMethods/TrinityChiSquared.lean` at the
null `b = 0` — was examined and **rejected**. Two independent reasons, in order of
severity.

**(1) The three frozen statements are false as they stand, for every `p ≥ 1`, so no
proof of them exists.** None of them constrains its estimator arguments to the data:
`archLRStat_chiSq_debt` takes `c0hat`, `bhat`, `c0null` merely measurable,
`archTR2Stat_chiSq_debt` takes `rss`, `tss` merely measurable, and
`archWaldStat_chiSq_debt` takes `bhat` measurable and `Ihat` entirely free. Choosing the
constants `c0hat = c0null = c0`, `bhat = 0` (resp. `rss = tss = 1`, resp. `bhat = 0`)
makes each statistic *identically zero*, so its law is `δ₀`, whose characteristic
function is the constant `1`; the conclusion then forces `charFun chiSq u = 1` for
every `u`, while `hchi` at `u = 1/2` gives `‖(1 − i)^{−p/2}‖ = 2^{−p/4} < 1`. (Both
halves of this contradiction were machine-checked.) The repair is not a proof but a
*statement* amendment, which is out of scope here: each debt needs the missing
`USER-INPUT` hypothesis that its estimator sequence is the actual (quasi-)MLE — or,
in the trinity's currency, is asymptotically linear with the ARCH score and information.

**(2) Even after that repair the trinity's shape does not fit.** Ranked by how hard
each mismatch is to bridge:

* *Fatal — the ARCH likelihood is not an iid likelihood.* The trinity's statistic is
  `logLRStatistic M est est₀ n ω = 2 Σᵢ log(p_{θ̂}(ωᵢ) / p_{θ̂₀}(ωᵢ))`: one factor per
  observation, from a single `ParametricFamily 𝓧 (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k))`.
  `archLRStat` is built from `archLogLik = −½ · garchQuasiLik`, i.e.
  `−½ Σ_{t=ν}^{T−1} (log σ̃_t² + x_t²/σ̃_t²)` with `σ̃_t²` the truncated ARCH recursion
  `garchTruncVol`, which reads back `p` lags of the *same* sample. The `t`-th summand is
  a function of `x_{t−1}, …, x_{t−p}` as well as `x_t`, so it is not `log p_θ(x_t)` for
  any density family: the two are different functions of the data, not one function in
  two notations. This is intrinsic, not an artefact of the definitions — the likelihood
  ratio must be evaluated across the whole `(c₀, b)` space, where the ARCH observations
  are genuinely dependent; the iid collapse of `IsARCH.iid_of_b_eq_zero` holds only on
  the null slice `b = 0`. It is exactly why FY cites Serfling §4.4.4 as the source of the
  *limit law* rather than instantiating an iid-likelihood theorem: what the null iid
  structure makes classical is the behaviour of the score and information *averages* at
  `b = 0`, not the likelihood itself.
* *Fatal — no truncation parameter.* `archLRStat` carries the presample index `ν`, and
  `archLRStat_chiSq_debt` carries `νseq` with `ν → ∞`, `ν/T → 0`. The trinity has no such
  parameter, so the truncated-versus-exact conditional-likelihood bookkeeping that those
  hypotheses exist to control lies entirely outside its statement.
* *Serious — regularity currency.* The trinity consumes `IsPDFOf`, joint measurability of
  `(θ, x) ↦ p_θ(x)`, `DifferentiableQuadraticMean` at `θ₀` with an explicit score,
  a positive-definite Fisher matrix in the `⟪u, J v⟫` normalisation, `IsAsymptoticallyLinear`
  estimator sequences in the full *and* restricted charts, and the amended **two-point**
  second-order envelope `henv` with an integrable envelope `Menv`. The debts here supply
  only `MemLp (ε 0) 4 μ`. Nothing in this development establishes quadratic-mean
  differentiability of the ARCH family, and the Fisher information of eq. (4.51) is named
  in this docstring but never defined.
* *Bridgeable, but not free — the sample law.* The trinity concludes about
  `productMeasure M μ θ₀ n = Measure.pi …` on `Fin n → 𝓧`, whereas the debts push forward
  `μ` on the process space `Ω`. `IsARCH.iid_of_b_eq_zero` does give that the null law of
  `(X₁, …, X_T)` is such a product, so this mismatch alone would be honest work rather
  than an obstruction.
* *Bridgeable, but not free — the conclusion form.* The trinity concludes
  `WeakConverges … (MultipleTesting.chiSquared p)`; the debts ask for pointwise `charFun`
  convergence to an abstract `chiSq` pinned by `hchi`. Bridging needs both
  `WeakConverges → charFun` convergence and `charFun (MultipleTesting.chiSquared p) u =
  (1 − 2iu)^{−p/2}`, and the latter is not proved anywhere in the repo at present.

Only the affine-null *geometry* lines up cleanly: `k = p + 1` with coordinates
`(c₀, b₁, …, b_p)`, null subspace `a + range B` for `m = 1`, `B : ℝ → ℝ^{p+1}` the first
coordinate inclusion, giving exactly the `p` degrees of freedom FY reports (and, per the
boundary caveat above, the unconstrained parametrization the trinity needs). That
agreement is real but superficial: it fixes the degrees of freedom, not the statistic.

**Verdict: the trinity is not reusable here.** The three limits stay as named debts, and
closing them calls for a *time-series* likelihood theorem — a martingale CLT for the
conditional score of the ARCH quasi-likelihood, valid over the whole `(c₀, b)` space —
rather than an instance of the iid one.

## The `hMLE` vacuity and its repair (2026-08-09b) — EXECUTED

**The finding (retained).** The `2026-08-09` amendment above, added to repair the falsity
diagnosed in item (1), overshot: it pinned the estimators by requiring them to *globally
maximize* `archLogLik` over **all** of `ℝ × ℝᵖ`. No such maximizer exists, so `hMLE` and
`hMLE0` were unsatisfiable and the two statements carried no statistical content — both
were proved by deriving `False` from their own hypotheses.

The witness is `archLogLik_unbounded` (machine-checked, **kept below**): with `b = 0` the
truncated volatility is the *constant* `c₀` (`truncVol_const`, no positivity used, because
the presample value of `archLogLik` is `c₀` itself), so at `c₀ = −δ < 0`

  `archLogLik (−δ) 0 x ν = −½·(T−ν)·log δ + (Σ_{t=ν}^{T−1} x_t²)/(2δ) → +∞`  as `δ ↓ 0`,

using `Real.log (−δ) = Real.log δ` and the *sign flip* of the `x_t²/σ̃_t²` term at a
negative `σ̃_t²`: both summands of `−½(log σ̃_t² + x_t²/σ̃_t²)` diverge to `+∞` together.
`hνT` forces `νseq T < T` for all large `T`, so the sum is nonempty at some `T` and
`hMLE`/`hMLE0` are contradicted there (`false_of_bddAbove_archLogLik`). This is not an
artefact of `Real.log`'s totalization: restricting to `c₀ > 0` does not help either, since
negative `b` coordinates drive `σ̃_t² = c₀ + Σ b_i x_{t−i}²` negative just the same.
Both lemmas are retained below as the *justification* for the amendment that follows.

**The repair, as executed.** `hMLE`/`hMLE0` now demand maximization over the **feasible
set** `K ∩ archAdmissible κ`, where

* `archAdmissible κ x ν = {(c₀, b) : σ̃_t²(c₀, b) ≥ κ for all t ∈ Ico ν T}` is the
  *data-adapted* locus on which the criterion is even defined, and
* `K` is a compact search region with the truth `(c₀, 0)` in its **interior** — the
  `hargmin`-over-`K` pattern of `ARMA/Consistency.lean`'s `mle_consistent` (Hannan §2);
* the null problem is posed on the slice `archNullSlice K = K ∩ {b = 0}`;
* the floor is **strict**, `0 < κ < c₀`.

Three certificates make this a repair rather than another guess, all proved here:

1. `exists_isMaxOn_archLogLik` (and its null companion) — the maximum *is attained*:
   `archAdmissible` is closed because with `q = 0` the truncated volatility is **affine**
   in `(c₀, b)` (`continuous_truncVol` — no recursion estimate needed), so the feasible set
   is compact, and `continuousOn_archLogLik` gives continuity there off the singularity.
2. `exists_archMLE_sequences` — estimator sequences satisfying `hMLE` *and* `hMLE0`
   verbatim **exist**, jointly. This is the exact converse of
   `false_of_bddAbove_archLogLik` and is what removes the vacuity. (It builds them by
   pointwise choice; measurability is still carried as the separate `USER-INPUT` `hmeas`,
   see the note at that theorem.)
3. `mem_interior_arch_feasible` — the truth is **interior** to the feasible set, so no
   constraint binds at the null. This is the reason the floor is imposed on the
   *data-adapted* set and not on `K`: FY's own admissible set `{b_j ≥ 0}` would put the
   null on the boundary of `K`, contradicting the interiority hypothesis and re-opening
   the one-sided boundary problem flagged above; and `κ = c₀` would do the same on the
   `c₀` axis, which is why the floor is strict.

**What is proved and what is owed.** With the repaired hypotheses, `p = 0` is *proved* for
both statements (the two feasible sets coincide, the LR statistic is identically `0`, the
Wald form is an empty sum, and `χ²₀ = δ₀` — this fixes the degrees-of-freedom
bookkeeping). `p ≥ 1` is an honest, satisfiable **debt**: the ARCH MLE asymptotics. Its
three bricks — (a) consistency of the constrained maximizer (the ARCH analogue of
`mle_consistent`), (b) the local quadratic expansion around the interior truth, (c) the
martingale CLT for the ARCH conditional score plus continuous mapping — are listed at the
theorems. The limit-law side of (c) is already discharged here
(`charFun_map_sum_sq_gaussian`, `eq_map_sum_sq_gaussian_of_charFun`).

`archTR2Stat_chiSq_debt`'s `hrss`/`htss` never had this defect: a least-squares minimum is
always attained, so its hypotheses were consistent throughout and it remains an honest
debt.

## `archTR2Stat_chiSq_debt`: the limit law is now identified, the LM limit is what is left

Two of the five mismatches listed above are **discharged**, both concerning the *statement*
of the limit rather than the statistic:

* the χ² **character identity** — recorded above as "not proved anywhere in the repo at
  present" — is proved here as `charFun_map_sum_sq_gaussian`:
  `charFun (law of Σ_{i<p} Z_i²) u = (1 − 2iu)^{−p/2}`, from the complex Gaussian integral
  `∫ exp(−b x²) = (π/b)^{1/2}` at `b = (1 − 2iu)/2` tensored over the `p` coordinates;
* the **conclusion form** — `eq_map_sum_sq_gaussian_of_charFun` turns `hchi` into
  `chiSq = (Measure.pi (gaussianReal 0 1)).map (Σ_i x_i²)` outright, so neither a χ²
  construction nor a `WeakConverges → charFun` bridge is needed anywhere. The debt's proof
  uses this to rewrite its goal into convergence towards that concrete law.

What this statement's `sorry` still needs is exactly Engle's LM limit: under `H₀` with
Gaussian innovations the squared data `Y_t = X_t²` are iid with mean `c₀` and variance
`2c₀² > 0`, `hrss`/`htss` make the statistic the auxiliary regression's `T·R²`, and the
normal equations turn it into a quadratic form in the lag-`1..p` sample autocovariances of
`Y`; the LLN sends the Gram matrix to `Var(Y)·I_p`, the iid CLT sends `√T γ̂` to
`N(0, Var(Y)²I_p)`, and continuous mapping finishes. Three bricks are missing: the
least-squares/`R²` algebra out of `hrss`, the `p`-dimensional CLT for the autocovariance
vector, and the continuous-mapping step. Note `p = 0` is consistent (both sides are `δ₀`).
Also, `hgauss` is not decoration *(this remark is documented, not formalized)*: with `ε`
Rademacher, `X_t² = c₀` a.s., so response and regressors are all equal, `rss = tss = 0`, and
the statistic is the constant `T` — a law `δ_T` with no limit. Nondegeneracy of `Var(X_t²)`
is therefore needed, and `hgauss` is what supplies it.

/-! ### The repair: a data-adapted admissible set on which the maximizer exists

`false_of_bddAbove_archLogLik` above is **retained as the justification** for what follows:
it is the machine-checked reason the earlier `hMLE`/`hMLE0` shape (a global maximizer over
all of `ℝ × ℝᵖ`) had to go. The replacement keeps FY's *unconstrained* parametrization for
`b` — which is what the `χ²_p` limit needs (see the boundary caveat in the module
docstring) — and instead cuts the parameter space by the **data-adapted admissible set**

  `archAdmissible κ x ν = {(c₀, b) : σ̃_t²(c₀, b) ≥ κ for every t in the criterion's range}`,

the exact locus on which the criterion's `log σ̃_t²` and `x_t²/σ̃_t²` are defined and
continuous. Two facts make this the minimal fix rather than another guess:

* it is **closed** — with `q = 0` the truncated volatility is *affine* in `(c₀, b)`
  (`continuous_truncVol`), so no recursion estimate is needed — hence `K ∩ archAdmissible`
  is compact for compact `K` and `archLogLik` attains its maximum there
  (`exists_isMaxOn_archLogLik`);
* it is **nonempty at the truth**: `(c₀, 0)` is admissible as soon as `κ ≤ c₀`
  (`mem_archAdmissible_of_b_eq_zero`, via `truncVol_const`), and `b` is *not* sign
  constrained, so the truth can sit in the **interior** of `K`. Constraining `K ⊆ {b ≥ 0}`
  instead — FY's own admissible set — would put the null on the *boundary* of `K` and so
  contradict `hK0`; that is the boundary problem FY flags, and avoiding it is why the
  variance floor is imposed on the *data-adapted* set rather than on `K`.

`exists_archMLE_sequences` then produces estimator sequences satisfying the repaired
hypotheses verbatim, so the repaired statements are **not** vacuous. -/

limit — as opposed to the one-sided mixture — is the right target. It is also why the
statements below carry `κ < c₀` and not `κ ≤ c₀`: at `κ = c₀` the null sits *on* the

/-- **FY eq. (4.50) — DEBT** (Serfling §4.4.4 via the iid structure under `H₀`): the
likelihood-ratio statistic has the `χ²_p` null limit.

**Statement strengthening (documented), 2026-08-09b — the de-vacuation.** The previous
`hMLE`/`hMLE0` asked for a maximizer of `archLogLik` over *all* of `ℝ × ℝᵖ`; no such point
exists (`archLogLik_unbounded`, `false_of_bddAbove_archLogLik`, both retained above), so
the statement was vacuous and its proof was a derivation of `False`. The hypotheses are now

* a **variance floor** `κ > 0` with `κ ≤ c₀`, and maximization over the *data-adapted*
  admissible set `archAdmissible κ` — the locus where the criterion is even defined;
* a **compact search region** `K` with the truth `(c₀, 0)` in its **interior** (the
  `hargmin`-over-`K` pattern of `ARMA/Consistency.lean`'s `mle_consistent`), the null
  problem being posed on the slice `archNullSlice K = K ∩ {b = 0}`.

Both `hMLE` and `hMLE0` are now **satisfiable**, and jointly so, by
`exists_archMLE_sequences`; the criterion attains its maximum on `K ∩ archAdmissible κ`
because that set is compact (`isClosed_archAdmissible`) and the criterion is continuous on
it (`continuousOn_archLogLik`). The floor is imposed on the *data-adapted* set and **not**
on `K`, deliberately: FY's own admissible set `{b_j ≥ 0}` would place the null on the
boundary of `K` and contradict `hK0`, which is exactly the boundary problem flagged in the
module docstring. `b` therefore stays unconstrained, as the `χ²_p` limit requires.

**Proved here:** the `p = 0` case (the statistic is then identically `0` — both problems
have the same feasible set — and `χ²₀ = δ₀`), which fixes the degrees-of-freedom
bookkeeping. **Debt:** `p ≥ 1`, i.e. the ARCH MLE asymptotics themselves; see the module
docstring for the ledger. -/

/-! ### The χ²_p character identity and the identification of the abstract limit law

The three debts take their limit law abstractly, pinned only by
`hchi : charFun chiSq u = (1 − 2iu)^{−p/2}`. That normalisation is *exactly* the
characteristic function of a Gaussian quadratic form `Σ_{i<p} Z_i²`, which is proved here
(`charFun_map_sum_sq_gaussian`) and used to identify `chiSq` outright
(`eq_map_sum_sq_gaussian_of_charFun`). This discharges two of the mismatches listed in the
module docstring — the χ² character identity, recorded there as "not proved anywhere in the
repo at present", and the "conclusion form" item: no χ² *construction* is needed, and no
`WeakConverges → charFun` bridge either. The route is the Fresnel-type Gaussian integral
`∫ exp(−b x²) = (π/b)^{1/2}` at `b = (1 − 2iu)/2`, tensored over the `p` coordinates by
Fubini. These belong in `MultipleTesting/ForMathlib/ChiSquared.lean` (whose `chiSquared p`
is `Gamma(p/2, 1/2)`, and where `map_sum_sq_eq_chiSquared` already identifies the law of
`Σ Z_i²`); they are `private` here only because that file is outside this lane's touch set. -/
