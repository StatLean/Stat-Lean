# CLT for kernel-localized sums under α-mixing (FY §2.6.4, Theorem 2.22)

The triangular-array CLT behind kernel regression with dependent data: for a strictly
stationary bivariate series `(X_t, e_t)` with `E(e|X) = 0`, the localized sums
`S_n(x) = Σ_{t=1}^n e_t W((X_t − x)/h_n)` satisfy
`(n h_n)^{-1/2} S_n(x) →d N(0, σ²(x) p(x) ∫ W²)` under (C1)–(C5). This is FY's
template for Theorem 6.3 (local-polynomial fitting) and the ch. 10 results.

**Conditions, as formalized.**
* (C1) joint strict stationarity (finite-dimensional-distribution form);
  `E(e_1 | X_1) = 0`, `E(e_1² | X_1) = σ²(X_1)`, `E|e_1|^δ < ∞` (δ > 2); the marginal
  `X_1` has a Lebesgue density `p`; `σ²`, `p` continuous at `x`, `p(x) > 0`.
* (C2) **as printed**, in its operative integrated form: uniformly in the lag `j ≠ 0`,
  `E[|f(e_0, e_j)| g(X_0, X_j)] ≤ B · E|f(e_0, e_j)| · ∫∫ g` for **every** measurable `f`
  and every nonnegative measurable `g`. This is exactly what "the conditional density of
  `(X_1, X_j)` given `(e_1, e_j)` is bounded uniformly in `j`" gives: condition on the
  errors, bound the conditional density of the `X`-pair by `B`, integrate the errors back
  out. The single instance `f = e_0 e_j` (plus `2|ab| ≤ a² + b²` and stationarity, which
  replace `E|e_0 e_j|` by `E[e_0²]`) is the small-lag variance bound (2.76); the *other*
  instances are what steps (b)–(c) need, because the conditional recentring inside
  `truncErr` strips the error factors out of the small-lag covariance (see
  `tendsto_smallBlock_variance`).
* (C3) α-mixing of the bivariate series (`pairAlphaCoeff`) with
  `Σ_t t^λ α(t)^{1−2/δ} < ∞` for some `λ > 1 − 2/δ`.
* (C4) `W` bounded and measurable with `∫|W| < ∞`, `∫ W² < ∞`.
* (C5) **as corrected**: the printed display is inverted; we take the endorsed
  sufficient form `h_n → 0`, `h_n > 0`, `n h_n³ → ∞` (which implies the intended
  polynomial lower bound `n h_n^{(λ+2−2/δ)/(λ+2/δ)} → ∞`).

conditions (C1)–(C5) and Theorem 2.22 (pp. 76–77); proof §2.7.7 (pp. 85–87).
(`FY §2.6.4 Thm 2.22`.)

**Proof route (§2.7.7, for the closure session).** (a) variance asymptotics
(2.73)–(2.76): main diagonal term by continuity of `σ²·p` + substitution; small lags
`j ≤ m_n = [1/(h|log h|)]` by (C2'); large lags by Davydov (`abs_covariance_le_davydov`
with `p = q = δ`) + (C3). (b) Bernstein blocks `l_n = [√(nh)/log n]`,
`s_n = [(√(n/h) log n)^{(1−2/δ)/(λ+1)}]`; negligibility (2.79)–(2.81) via the variance
part. (c) truncation of `e` at level `L`; variance split (2.82)–(2.83).
(d) 4-term charFun telescope: truncation tail + Volkonskii–Rozanov
(`norm_integral_prod_sub_prod_integral_le`; `16(k_n − 1)α(s_n) → 0` by (2.78)) +
degenerate Lindeberg (`tendsto_charFun_rowSum_gaussian_of_uniformly_small`; the
truncated block summands have envelope `l_n L sup|W| / √(nh) → 0`) + `ν_L → ν`.
Sub-steps may be left as **named ledger-(a) debts** if the wave budget is hit.
[Print slips (recorded in the inventory): Term-1 of the telescope is missing a `½`
exponent; the final "(2.83)" should read "(2.84)".]

**Status of the ledger.** `kernel_localized_clt` is assembled (no `sorry` of its own)
from the two step-(d) inputs through the proved `tendsto_of_uniform_approx`. Proved in
full: the four analytic bricks (`integral_dilate_translate`,
`integral_comp_eq_integral_density`, `integral_bdd_comp_mul_eq_of_condExp`,
`tendsto_integral_dilate_of_bounded`), the repaired diagonal
`tendsto_localized_second_moment_of_bounded`, the small-lag bound (2.76)
`small_lag_covariance_bound`, the large-lag Davydov bound (2.75)
`large_lag_covariance_bound`, the pair-σ-algebra transport, and the `pairAlphaCoeff`
basics; and, under the authorized (C1) repair, the diagonal (2.73) itself
(`tendsto_localized_second_moment_debt`, with `nonneg_of_continuousAt_of_ae_nonneg`);
and the Volkonskii–Rozanov rate (2.78) `tendsto_blockCount_mul_pairAlpha`, with its
(C3) input `tendsto_weighted_antitone_of_summable`; and, under the authorized (2.74)
repair, **the whole of ledger (a)**: `var_localized_sum`, together with its apparatus
— the fdd-stationarity law transport (`map_pair_eq_of_stat`, `integral_comp_pair_eq`,
`map_pair2_eq_of_stat`, `integral_comp_pair2_eq`, `eLpNorm_comp_pair_eq`,
`memLp_comp_pair`), the stationary double-sum estimates `abs_double_sum_sub_diag_le` and
`abs_double_sum_subset_le`, the localized δ-moment `localized_delta_moment_le` (this is
(2.74) itself), the truncation-tail diagonal `sq_sub_clamp_le` /
`localized_trunc_residual_moment_le`, and the bandwidth limits
`tendsto_smallLagCut_mul_bandwidth`, `tendsto_rpow_mul_abs_log_rpow`.

**New this wave** — the *time-transport* apparatus that steps (b)–(c) need and ledger (a)
did not, all proved and axiom-clean:
* `map_fst_eq_of_stat`, `ae_comp_X_of_stat` — the `X`-marginal and a.e. statements about it
  move across time;
* `exists_condExp_repr_of_stat` — under fdd stationarity `E(φ(e_t) | X_t)` is the **same**
  measurable function of `X_t` at every `t` (Doob–Dynkin at `t = 0`, then the set-integral
  characterization transports because both sides are integrals of a fixed function of the
  pair);
* `condExp_eq_zero_of_stat` — (C1)'s `E(e | X) = 0` at *every* time, not just `t = 0`;
* `measurable_clampAt`, `abs_clampAt_le`, `exists_truncErr_repr` — one bounded measurable
  `mL` with `e^L_t = clamp_L(e_t) − mL(X_t)` a.e. simultaneously in `t`, so that the
  truncated covariance array is a function of the lag alone;
* `localized_weight_integral_le` — `E[G((X_0 − x)/h)] ≤ (C_p ∫G) h`, the `Y ≡ 1` case of the
  density change of variables (at `G = |W|^δ` it is the truncated summand's δ-th moment: no
  conditional moment is needed there, the error factor being bounded by `2L`).

The three former debts, each with its verified falsity witness and its
**Statement strengthening (documented)** paragraph in its own docstring. All three were
**false as frozen**; all three statements were **repaired**, and the repairs are exactly the
ones the witnesses prescribe. **All three are now PROVED, and the file is `sorry`-free**:
* `tendsto_smallBlock_variance` (2.79)–(2.81) — was hypothesis-free; now carries the full
  (C1)–(C5) package plus `0 < L`, and (C2) in its printed form (the second obstruction: the
  conditional recentring inside `truncErr` strips both error factors out of the small-lag
  covariance, so the *unweighted* instance `f ≡ 1` is what closes it). **PROVED (this wave),
  in the repaired form.** The route recorded here was run as written: (i) the covariance
  assembly for the truncated array — diagonal `|G_ζ(0)| ≤ 4L² C_p (∫W²) h` from
  `localized_weight_integral_le`, small lags from (C2) at `f ≡ 1`, large lags from Davydov
  (`large_lag_covariance_bound'`) as in ledger (a) — is `tendsto_truncIndex_variance`, stated
  for an *arbitrary* index family `I n ⊆ range n` with `|I n| / n → 0`; and (ii) the numerology
  `k_n s_n / n → 0` (`tendsto_blockCount_mul_smallBlockLen_div`) reduces to `s_n / l_n → 0` and
  thence to `n^{1−θ} h^{1+θ} / (log n)^{2+2θ} → ∞` with `θ = (1−2/δ)/(λ+1) < 1/2`; that in turn
  is `(n h³)^{(1+θ)/3} · n^{(2−4θ)/3} / (log n)^{2+2θ} → ∞`, i.e. exactly (C5) with room to
  spare.
* `charFun_locSum_sub_locTruncSum_le` (2.82)–(2.83) — was missing stationarity and every
  moment condition beyond time `0`; now carries the same package. **PROVED (this wave), in
  the repaired form**, by the route recorded below, run as written.
  Route: `‖e^{iuS} − e^{iuT}‖ ≤ |u| E|S − T|` and `|z| ≤ z²/(2c) + c/2` (no square root
  needed), then the residual array `ρ_t = (r_t − E(r_t|X_t)) W_t`, `r_t = e_t − clamp_L e_t`,
  with `E(e_t|X_t) = 0` supplied at every `t` by `condExp_eq_zero_of_stat`. Diagonal:
  `localized_trunc_residual_moment_le`, `O(L^{2−δ})` after the `h⁻¹`, uniformly in `n`.
  Small lags: (C2) at `f(z) = (|r(z.1)| + c)(|r(z.2)| + c)` with `c = L^{1−δ}M` (the pointwise
  bound `|r_0| ≤ L^{1−δ}|e_0|^δ` is what makes the recentring constant decay in `L`).
  Large lags: Davydov; note the δ-moment constant there does **not** decay in `L` under
  `heδc`, so the uniformity in `n` has to be obtained by splitting at some `N` (large `n`:
  the factor `h^{2/δ−1+λ}|log h|^λ` is itself small; small `n`: the crude bound
  `E|S_n − T_n| ≤ √(n/h_n) C_W · 2L^{1−δ}M` closes at fixed `n`). This is recorded because it
  is *not* a further silent reading — the frozen package suffices, but only after the split.
* `tendsto_charFun_locTruncSum` ((b) + (d) at fixed `L`, and (2.84)) — was refutable already
  for an iid series: at a fixed truncation level the limit needs continuity at `x` of the
  *truncated* conditional second moment `σ_L²·p`, which (C1) does not supply. Repaired by the
  `mL`/`sL` family with `hσLc`, `hσLb`, `hσL84`. **PROVED (this wave), in the repaired
  form.** The Bernstein-block core was run in full; see its docstring for the route and the
  private apparatus it required.

With that, the **headline** `kernel_localized_clt` — FY Theorem 2.22 — is proved outright.
What the three verdicts say is that FY §2.7.7's *route* to it needs four silent readings of
(C1) and (C2) as printed, not two.

**Note on `Mixing/Inequalities.lean`.** The sibling repair — making the frozen
`norm_integral_prod_sub_prod_integral_le` the `0 < k` statement (its `k = 0` corner is
false: `‖1 − 1‖ = 0 ≤ 16·(0−1)·a` fails for `a > 0`) — was attempted this wave and
**reverted**: `StatLean/TimeSeries/Mixing/LimitTheorems.lean:998`
(`norm_integral_prod_blocks_sub_prod_le`, private, and itself false at `k = 0` for the same
reason) consumes the frozen name at unconstrained `k`, and that file is outside this wave's
touch-set. The repair is one line in each of the two files; the content is already available
as `norm_integral_prod_sub_prod_integral_le_of_pos`.

**FALSE AS FROZEN (verified) — REPAIRS APPLIED.** FY (2.73)–(2.76) — hence Theorem 2.22
itself — does not follow from (C1)–(C5) *as formalized here*. Two independent gaps were
found and both counterexamples/obstructions stand; the authorized amendments of (C1) have
been applied to `kernel_localized_clt`, `tendsto_localized_second_moment_debt`,
`var_localized_sum` and `tendsto_charFun_locTruncSum`:

* the **second**-moment gap, repaired by `(hσm : Measurable σsq)` and
  `(hσpb : ∃ C, ∀ v, σsq v * p v ≤ C)`. Under them the diagonal (2.73) is **proved**
  (`tendsto_localized_second_moment_debt`); note that only the *upper* half of the bound is
  assumed — the lower half is derived from `σ²` being a conditional second moment. The
  record of the failure as frozen is below.
* the **δ**-th-moment gap, FY's implicit (2.74), repaired by
  `(heδc : μ[|e 0|^δ | σ(X 0)] ≤ᵐ M)` together with `(hpb : ∀ v, p v ≤ Cp)`. Under them
  ledger (a) `var_localized_sum` is **proved**. The obstruction proof — that no combination
  of the frozen inputs closes the large-lag sum for `λ ≤ 1`, which is the range (C3)
  actually allows — is kept in `var_localized_sum`'s docstring.

The record of the second-moment failure as frozen:

The diagonal term equals, identically,
`∫ (σ²·p)(x + h u) W²(u) du` (this identity is proved, inside
`tendsto_localized_second_moment_of_bounded`), and its convergence to `σ²(x)p(x)∫W²`
needs control of the range `|u| > M`, which continuity of `σ²·p` **at `x`** does not
give. (C2) forces only `σ·p` bounded, never `σ²·p`; and `σ²·p ∈ L¹` (`= E e_0² < ∞`) is
too weak against a merely-`L¹` weight `W²`. See
`tendsto_localized_second_moment_debt`'s docstring for the explicit spike/kernel
counterexample and the two possible repairs (compactly supported `W`, or `σ²·p`
bounded — the latter is the textbook's silent reading of (C1)). Note also that (C1) as
frozen carries **no measurability hypothesis on `σsq`**; only `hcv` constrains it, and
only `μ.map (X 0)`-a.e.

**Bibliographic comments.** Theorem 2.22 descends from Masry & Fan, *Local polynomial
estimation of regression functions for mixing processes* (Scand. J. Statist. 1997) and
Fan & Gijbels (1996) §6.5; the Bernstein-block scheme under (C3) follows Bosq (1998).

/-! ### The §2.7.7 ledger

The proof apparatus of FY §2.7.7, as named private declarations. `locSum` is the
statistic of Theorem 2.22 itself; `locTruncSum` is its truncated-and-recentred
companion of step (c); `bigBlockLen`/`smallBlockLen`/`blockCount`/`smallLagCut` are
FY's `l_n`, `s_n`, `k_n`, `m_n`.

**What is proved here**: the small-lag covariance bound (2.76) — the one ledger-(a)
item that the formalized (C2) delivers outright — and the abstract diagonal-limit
device that the four-term telescope of step (d) is squeezed through. The remaining
items are named debts, one per FY display. -/

/-- **FY (2.73), diagonal term — REPAIRED AND PROVED.**
`h⁻¹ E[e_0² W²((X_0 − x)/h)] = ∫ (σ²·p)(x + h u) W²(u) du` (an *identity*, proved
inside `tendsto_localized_second_moment_of_bounded`), and FY asserts the limit
`σ²(x) p(x) ∫ W²`.

**Status: PROVED, under the authorized repair** — the two hypotheses `hσm`/`hσpb` below
are the laptop-authorized amendment of (C1) (the textbook's silent reading; see the
module docstring's FALSE-AS-FROZEN section). The record of *why* the amendment is
necessary is kept verbatim below.

Note that `hσpb` is only a **one-sided** (upper) bound: the matching lower bound is not
assumed but *derived*, since `σ²` is a conditional second moment, hence `≥ 0` a.e. for
the law of `X_0`, hence `σ²·p ≥ 0` Lebesgue-a.e. (this is where `hσm` is spent — it makes
`{v | 0 ≤ σ²(v)}` measurable, so the a.e. statement transports through
`ae_map_iff`/`ae_withDensity_iff`). The proof then runs
`tendsto_localized_second_moment_of_bounded` on the clipped `max σ² 0`, which agrees with
`σ²` a.e.-`μ` under the conditional expectation, and agrees with it *at the point* `x` by
`nonneg_of_continuousAt_of_ae_nonneg`.

**Why the repair is needed.** The limit needs more than the formalized (C1)–(C5) supply
(this was verified in the previous wave). Continuity of
`σ²·p` at `x` controls the window `|u| ≤ M` (there `|h u| ≤ M h → 0`), but the tail
`|u| > M` is left uncontrolled: `(C2)` forces only `σ·p` to be bounded (take
`g = g₁ ⊗ g₂` in (C2) and let `g` concentrate), **not** `σ²·p`, and `σ²·p ∈ L¹` alone
(`= E e_0² < ∞`) is not enough against a merely-`L¹` weight `W²`. Concretely: with
`σ p ≡ B` on a sequence of spikes escaping to `v ≈ x + 1`, `σ²p = (σp)²/p` is
unbounded, and choosing `W² = 1` on intervals `J_k ≈ 2^k` of length `2^{-k}`
(so `W` is bounded, `∫|W| < ∞`, `∫W² < ∞`) makes
`∫ (σ²p)(x + h_k u) W²(u) du ≥ σ²(x)p(x)∫W² + 1` along `h_k = 2^{-k}` while `σ²`, `p`
stay continuous at `x`. Sparsifying the spike sequence keeps `h_n → 0` compatible with
`n h_n³ → ∞`, so (C5) does not rescue it.

**Repair (APPLIED).** Either strengthen (C4) to compactly supported `W` (then continuity
at `x` suffices and this lemma is `tendsto_localized_second_moment_of_bounded`'s window
argument), or strengthen (C1) to `σ²·p` bounded — which is what the textbook's
"(C1) with `σ²` and `p` bounded" silently supplies. The second route is the one taken:
`hσpb` below, together with the measurability `hσm` that the frozen (C1) also omitted
(only `hcv` constrains `σsq`, and only `μ.map (X 0)`-a.e.). -/

/-! #### Law transport from the fdd form of stationarity

FY's (C1) is frozen here in its *finite-dimensional-distribution* form: the law of the
`k`-window `(X_{t+i}, e_{t+i})_{i<k}` does not depend on `t`. These four lemmas are the
only consequences ledger (a) needs — the one-time and two-time marginals, and the
transport of integrals, `eLpNorm`s and `MemLp` of a fixed function of the pair. Each is
obtained by pushing the `hstat` identity forward along a coordinate evaluation. -/

/-- **Conditional expectations transport across time — PROVED.** Under the fdd form of
stationarity, the conditional expectation `E(φ(e_t) | X_t)` is, for *every* `t`, the same
measurable function `m` of `X_t`. This is the brick steps (b)–(c) need but ledger (a) did
not: `truncErr` is built from `E(clamp_L(e_t) | X_t)` at each time separately, so the
truncated array is a fixed function of the pair `(X_t, e_t)` only once these versions are
identified.

Two ingredients: Doob–Dynkin (`StronglyMeasurable.exists_eq_measurable_comp`) produces the
factorization `m` at `t = 0`, and the defining set-integral characterization of the
conditional expectation transports to time `t` because both sides of
`∫_{X_t ∈ A} m(X_t) = ∫_{X_t ∈ A} φ(e_t)` are integrals of a *fixed* function of the pair,
namely `Prod.fst ⁻¹' A`-indicators, so `integral_comp_pair_eq` applies to each. -/

/-- **`truncErr` is a fixed function of the pair, up to a null set — PROVED.** There is
one bounded measurable `mL` with `e^L_t = clamp_L(e_t) − mL(X_t)` a.e., simultaneously for
every `t`. This is what steps (b)–(c) need in order to run the ledger-(a) machinery on the

each time, and without the identification its covariance array would not be a function of
the lag alone.

`exists_condExp_repr_of_stat` at `φ = clamp_L` gives a common measurable version `m`;

/-- **The stationary double sum, off the diagonal.** If a doubly-indexed array `c` depends
only on the lag (`c s (s+d) = c (s+d) s = g d`), then its full `n × n` sum differs from the
diagonal contribution `n · g 0` by at most `2 n Σ_{1 ≤ j < n} |g j|`. This is the purely
combinatorial half of FY (2.73): each row contributes `g 0` plus a lag sum in both

/-- **The stationary double sum over an arbitrary index set.** Same hypothesis as
`abs_double_sum_sub_diag_le` — the array `c` depends only on the lag — but the sum runs
over an arbitrary `I ⊆ range n` rather than over all of `range n`, and the diagonal is
kept on the right instead of being subtracted off:
`|Σ_{s,t ∈ I} c s t| ≤ |I| (|g 0| + 2 Σ_{1 ≤ j < n} |g j|)`.

This is the combinatorial half of the small-block estimate (2.79)–(2.81): there `I` is the
union of the `k_n` small blocks, of total length `N_n = k_n s_n` with `N_n / n → 0`, and
the two factors are exactly the ones ledger (a) already controls — the diagonal
`|g 0| = O(h)` and the lag sum `Σ_j |g j| = o(h)` — so that
`(n h_n)⁻¹ |Σ_{s,t ∈ I}| ≤ (N_n / n) · h_n⁻¹ (|g 0| + 2 Σ_j |g j|) → 0`. The proof is the
one of `abs_double_sum_sub_diag_le` with `range n` replaced by `I` in the row split; `hI`
is what keeps the two lag injections landing in `Ico 1 n`.

Note that this brick is *not* the obstruction to (2.79)–(2.81): the analytic half is (see
`tendsto_smallBlock_variance`, whose summands are the **truncated** ones, for which the
small-lag input `Σ_j |g j| = o(h)` needs (C2) in its unweighted form). -/

kernel-localized summand `ξ_0 = e_0 W((X_0 − x)/h)` obeys
`E|ξ_0|^δ ≤ (M · Cp · ∫|W|^δ) · h`, i.e. `E|ξ_0|^δ = O(h)`.

Three steps: pull `|W((X_0−x)/h)|^δ` out of the conditional expectation of `|e_0|^δ`
(`integral_bdd_comp_mul_eq_of_condExp`, legitimate because `|W|^δ ≤ CW^δ` is bounded),
substitute the density (`integral_comp_eq_integral_density`), and rescale
(`integral_dilate_translate`); the factor `h` is the Jacobian. Integrability of `|W|^δ`
comes from `|W|^δ ≤ CW^{δ−2} W²` — the only place `δ > 2` is used here. -/

/-! #### FY (2.82)–(2.83): the truncation tail

Step (c) truncates `e` at level `L`; what the telescope needs is that the residual
`e_t − e^L_t` contributes a variance that vanishes as `L → ∞`, *uniformly in `n`*. The two
bricks below are the diagonal half of that estimate — the half that (C1)–(C5) as
formalized do support. (The lag half does not close; see `tendsto_smallBlock_variance`.) -/

/-- **Pointwise truncation residual — PROVED.** `(z − clamp_L z)² ≤ L^{2−δ} |z|^δ` for
`δ > 2`, `L > 0`. Below the clamp the left side is `0`; above it `|z − clamp_L z| ≤ |z|`
and `|z|² = |z|^{2−δ}|z|^δ ≤ L^{2−δ}|z|^δ`, the exponent `2 − δ` being negative. This is
where `δ > 2` buys the `L → ∞` decay of the truncation tail. -/

/-- **FY (2.82)–(2.83), the diagonal of the truncation tail — PROVED.** The localized
second moment of the truncation residual carries *both* small factors at once:
`E[(e_0 − clamp_L e_0)² W((X_0−x)/h)²] ≤ (M · C_p · ∫W²) · L^{2−δ} h`,
so after the `h⁻¹` of the normalization it is `O(L^{2−δ})` — vanishing as `L → ∞`
uniformly in `n` and in the bandwidth, which is exactly the uniformity (2.82) needs.

Same three steps as `localized_delta_moment_le`, with the weight `|W|^δ` replaced by `W²`:
dominate pointwise by `L^{2−δ} |e_0|^δ W²` (`sq_sub_clamp_le`), pull `W²` out of the
conditional expectation of `|e_0|^δ` and bound the latter by `M`
(`integral_bdd_comp_mul_eq_of_condExp` with `heδc`), then substitute the density
(`integral_comp_eq_integral_density`) and rescale (`integral_dilate_translate`), the factor
`h` being the Jacobian and `C_p` the density bound.

This bounds the residual *before* its conditional recentring; since
`e_t − e^L_t = r_t − E(r_t | X_t)` with `r_t = e_t − clamp_L(e_t)`, conditional Jensen
turns it into the same bound for the recentred residual at no cost. What it does **not**
give — and what blocks (2.82) as a whole — is the corresponding *lag* estimate; see
`tendsto_smallBlock_variance` for the proof that the frozen (C2) cannot supply it. -/

/-- **FY (2.73)–(2.76), the ledger-(a) headline — PROVED under the authorized (2.74)
repair.** `(n h_n)⁻¹ Var(S_n(x)) → σ²(x) p(x) ∫ W²`.

Assembled from three inputs: the diagonal (`tendsto_localized_second_moment_debt`, now
**proved** under the authorized (C1) repair), the small lags `1 ≤ j ≤ smallLagCut h n`
via `small_lag_covariance_bound` (total `m_n · h² / h = h/|log h| → 0`), and the large
lags `j > smallLagCut h n` via `large_lag_covariance_bound` + (C3)'s weighted summability
(`Σ_{j>m} α^{1−2/δ}(j) ≤ m^{−λ} Σ j^λ α^{1−2/δ}(j)`). Stationarity (`hstat`) turns the
double sum over `1 ≤ s, t ≤ n` into `n` times a single lag sum. Mean-zero of each summand
(from `hce` through `integral_bdd_comp_mul_eq_of_condExp`) is what lets the variance be
read off the second moment.

**Why the repair is needed — BLOCKED AS FROZEN (verified; a *separate* gap from the one
the `hσm`/`hσpb` repair fixes).** The large-lag half does not close under (C1)–(C5) as
formalized here,
for any `λ ≤ 1`. FY's step is `|Cov(ξ_0, ξ_j)| ≤ 8 α(j)^{1−2/δ} ‖ξ_0‖_δ ‖ξ_j‖_δ` with the
**kernel-localized δ-norm** `‖ξ_0‖_δ² = O(h^{2/δ})`, i.e. `E|ξ_0|^δ = O(h)`; then
`h⁻¹ · h^{2/δ} · m_n^{−λ} = h^{λ + 2/δ − 1} |log h|^λ → 0`, which is *exactly* (C3)'s
`λ > 1 − 2/δ`. But `E|ξ_0|^δ = E[|e_0|^δ |W((X_0−x)/h)|^δ]` factorizes only through a
**conditional** δ-moment `E(|e_0|^δ | X_0) ≤ M` (with `p` bounded), and the frozen (C1)
supplies only the *unconditional* `MemLp (e 0) δ` (`heLδ`), which gives merely
`‖ξ_0‖_δ ≤ CW ‖e_0‖_δ = O(1)` — no `h`-gain at all.

The gap is not repairable by interpolating the inputs that *are* available. Writing
`β = 1 − 2/δ`, what the file has is `‖ξ_0‖_2 = O(√h)` (this **is** new, and comes from the
authorized repair: `E ξ_0² = ∫ (σ²p)(x+hu)W(u)²du ≤ C h ∫W²`), `‖ξ_0‖_δ = O(1)`, and the
`(C2)` bound `|E[ξ_0 ξ_j]| = O(h²)` valid at *every* lag. Hölder interpolation at
`2 < q ≤ δ` gives `‖ξ_0‖_q = O(h^{θ/2})` with `1/q = θ/2 + (1−θ)/δ`, and the Davydov
exponent is then `1 − 2/q = β(1−θ)`, so the large-lag total is
`h^{θ−1} Σ_{j>m} α(j)^{β(1−θ)}`. With `s := 1 − θ`, `(C3)` gives only
`α(j)^β = o(j^{−λ})`, hence `α(j)^{βs} = o(j^{−λs})`, whose tail converges only when
`λ s > 1`; since `s ≤ 1` this forces `λ > 1`. Taking instead the `(C2)` bound on the same
range costs `n h → ∞`. So for `λ ∈ (1 − 2/δ, 1]` — the range (C3) actually allows —
every combination of the frozen inputs diverges.

**Missing input, precisely.** FY's implicit (2.74): `E|ξ_0|^δ ≤ K h` (equivalently:
`E(|e_0|^δ | X_0) ≤ M` a.e. together with `p` bounded). This is a *third* silent reading
of (C1), independent of the two already authorized (`hσm`, `hσpb` bound `σ²·p`, i.e. the
**second** conditional moment; they do not bound the δ-th).

**Statement strengthening (documented).** FY's (C1) as printed asserts only the
*unconditional* `E|e_1|^δ < ∞` (`heLδ`). We additionally assume its **conditional** form
`E(|e_0|^δ | X_0) ≤ M` a.e. (`heδc`) together with a bounded density (`hpb`) — FY's
implicit (2.74), the *third* silent reading of (C1). The paragraph above is the proof
that no weaker package built from the frozen hypotheses suffices: interpolating the
available `‖ξ_0‖_2 = O(√h)`, `‖ξ_0‖_δ = O(1)` and the (C2) bound leaves a large-lag tail
that converges only for `λ > 1`, whereas (C3) as frozen allows `λ ∈ (1 − 2/δ, 1]`. The two
hypotheses are spent in exactly one place, `localized_delta_moment_le`, which converts
them into `E|ξ_0|^δ ≤ (M · Cp · ∫|W|^δ) h`; nothing else in the proof sees them. They
propagate to `tendsto_charFun_locTruncSum` and to the Theorem 2.22 headline
`kernel_localized_clt`, which consume ledger (a). Note that `hnh` ((C5)'s `n h³ → ∞`),
`hpx`, and `hW1` are *not* needed for the variance asymptotics — only `h_n → 0` is — and
are kept because they are part of the frozen (C1)–(C5) package. -/

/-- **Antitone weighted summability gains one power — PROVED.** If `a` is nonnegative and
antitone and `Σ t^λ a(t)^β < ∞` (`λ, β > 0`), then `t^{λ+1} a(t)^β → 0`. Summability alone
gives only `t^λ a(t)^β → 0`; the extra power comes from the dyadic block
`Σ_{j ∈ [T/2, T)} j^λ a(j)^β ≥ (T/2)^{λ+1} a(T)^β`, whose left side is a difference of two
partial sums and hence vanishes. This is the form of (C3) that FY's (2.78) actually
uses. -/

/-- **FY (2.78) — PROVED.** The Volkonskii–Rozanov error of step (d) vanishes:
`k_n · α_pair(s_n) → 0`.

The exponent arithmetic, with `β = 1 − 2/δ` and `A_n = √(n/h_n) log n`: the block count
obeys `k_n ≤ n/l_n ≤ A_n` (that is what `l_n = [√(n h_n)/log n]` is for), while
`s_n = [A_n^{β/(λ+1)}]` gives `A_n ≤ s_n^{(λ+1)/β}`. Hence
`(k_n α(s_n))^β ≤ A_n^β α(s_n)^β ≤ s_n^{λ+1} α(s_n)^β → 0`
by `tendsto_weighted_antitone_of_summable` (`s_n → ∞`), and `k_n α(s_n) → 0` follows by
continuity of `y ↦ y^{1/β}` at `0`.

Note that (C5) (`hnh`) is **not needed**: (2.78) holds for any bandwidth sequence with
`h_n → 0`. (C5) is what makes `s_n = o(l_n)`, which is used elsewhere in step (b), not
here. -/

/-- **FY (2.79)–(2.81) — FALSE AS FROZEN (verified), REPAIRED.** The small blocks (and the
terminal remainder) are `L²`-negligible: their contribution to `locTruncSum` has variance
`→ 0`. The proof is ledger (a) applied to the small-block index sets, whose total length is
`N_n = k_n s_n` with `N_n / n → 0` by the choice of `l_n`, `s_n` (that ratio is
`s_n/(l_n+s_n) → 0`, which is exactly what (C5) buys).

**The statement as frozen carried no hypotheses at all** — `X`, `e`, `W`, `x`, `δ`, `lam`,
`h`, `L` were all free — so it was false, and not for a pathological reason: without
independence/mixing the small-block sum grows *quadratically* in its length instead of
linearly. Witness: `X ≡ 0` (so `σ(X_t)` is trivial), `e_t ≡ ξ` for a single Rademacher
`ξ`, `W ≡ 1`, `h ≡ 1`, `L ≥ 1`, `δ = 3`, `lam = 1`. Then
`truncErr = clamp_L ξ − E[clamp_L ξ] = ξ`, the double sum is `N_n · ξ` with
`N_n = k_n s_n`, the integral is `N_n²`, and the displayed quantity is `N_n²/n`. Here
`l_n = ⌈√n/log n⌉`, `s_n = ⌈(√n log n)^{1/6}⌉`, `k_n ≍ √n log n`, so
`N_n ≍ n^{7/12+o(1)}` and `N_n²/n ≍ n^{1/6} → ∞`.

**Second obstruction (verified): threading (C1)–(C5) as frozen is *not* sufficient
either.** The summands here are the **truncated** ones `ζ_t = e^L_t W((X_t − x)/h_n)` with
`e^L_t = clamp_L(e_t) − E(clamp_L(e_t) | X_t)`, and the ledger-(a) route needs the
small-lag bound `|E[ζ_0 ζ_j]| = O(h²)` (FY (2.76)) on the whole range `1 ≤ j ≤ m_n`. The
combinatorial half is fine — `abs_double_sum_subset_le` is `abs_double_sum_sub_diag_le`
with `range n` replaced by an arbitrary index set, which is all the small blocks need — and
the diagonal and large-lag halves go through unchanged (`|ζ_0| ≤ 2L |W_0|`, so
`‖ζ_0‖_δ = O(h^{1/δ})` by the density change of variables). The small-lag half is not.
Conditioning on `(X_0, X_j)` writes
`E[ζ_0 ζ_j] = E[ψ_L(X_0, X_j) · W((X_0−x)/h) W((X_j−x)/h)]` with `|ψ_L| ≤ 4 L²`: the
conditional recentring has removed **both** error factors, so what the estimate needs is
an *unweighted* bounded joint density for `(X_0, X_j)`. The **frozen** (C2) — the single
instance weighted by `|e_0 e_j|` — supplies only the weighted one, and does not imply it.
The two substitutes available from the frozen package both diverge over the small-lag
range: the crude `|E[ζ_0 ζ_j]| ≤ 4 L² C_W · E|W((X_0−x)/h)| = O(h)` (bounded density) gives
`h⁻¹ · m_n · O(h) = O(m_n) → ∞`, and Davydov gives `h^{2/δ−1} Σ_j α(j)^{1−2/δ} → ∞`
since `2/δ < 1`.

**Statement strengthening (documented).** Two repairs, both authorized:
(i) the whole (C1)–(C5) package is threaded, exactly as `var_localized_sum` carries it
(`hstat`, `hce`, `hcv`, `hδ`/`heLδ`, the (2.73)/(2.74) readings `hσm`/`hσpb`/`heδc`/`hpb`,
`hC2`, `hlam`/`hα`, `hWm`/`hWb`/`hW1`/`hW2`, `hh0`/`hh`/`hnh`), plus `0 < L`; the witness
above shows each of the mixing and moment inputs is load-bearing.
(ii) (C2) is now carried in FY's **printed** form — the bound at an arbitrary error weight
`f`, not just at `f = e_0 e_j` — which is exactly what the second obstruction identifies as
missing; see the module docstring. The instance used here is `f ≡ 1` (unweighted), together
with `f = ` the two singly-weighted ones produced by expanding the recentring.
As in `var_localized_sum`, `hpx`, `hσc`, `hσpb` and `hσm` are carried for uniformity with
the rest of the ledger and are not consumed by this estimate.

**Status: PROVED**, over `tendsto_truncIndex_variance` (the covariance assembly, at an
arbitrary index family) and `tendsto_blockCount_mul_smallBlockLen_div` (the numerology),
applied to the small-block index set `smallBlockIdx`. -/

/-- **FY (2.82)–(2.83), truncation tail — FALSE AS FROZEN (verified), REPAIRED.**
Uniformly in `n`, the charFun of the localized sum is within `ε` of the charFun of its
truncated companion once the truncation level `L` is large. Proof:
`|e^{iuS} − e^{iuS^L}| ≤ |u| E|S − S^L|`, and the variance of `S − S^L` obeys the
ledger-(a) bound with the factor `E[e²1_{|e|>L}]`, which vanishes as `L → ∞` by
`δ`-moment uniform integrability (`heLδ`, `δ > 2`).

**FALSE AS FROZEN (verified).** The frozen hypotheses omitted (C1)'s stationarity and
*every* moment condition beyond time `0`: `heLδ` constrains `e 0` only, and there was no
`hstat`, `hce`, `hcv`, `hC2` or `hα`. Witness: `x = 0`, `X ≡ 0`, `W = 1_{[0,1]}` (so
`W((X_t − x)/h_n) ≡ W 0 = 1`, and `W` is bounded, integrable and square-integrable as
(C4) demands), `h_n = n^{−1/4}` (so `h_n → 0` and `n h_n³ = n^{1/4} → ∞`, as (C5)
demands), `e_0 = 0` (so `heLδ` holds for every `δ`) and `e_t = t·ζ` for `t ≥ 1` with
`ζ ~ N(0,1)`. Then `locSum = n^{−3/8}·(n(n+1)/2)·ζ`, whose charFun `→ 0`; whereas
`clamp_L(tζ) → L·sign ζ` pointwise as `t → ∞`, so
`locTruncSum = n^{5/8} L · sign ζ + o(1)` a.s. and its charFun is
`cos(u n^{5/8} L) + o(1)`. The steps of `n ↦ u n^{5/8} L` tend to `0` while the sequence
diverges, so its residues mod `2π` are dense: `|cos| ≥ 1/2` for infinitely many `n`, at
**every** fixed `L`. So `ε = 1/4` admits no `L` at all.

**Statement strengthening (documented).** The full (C1)–(C5) package that
`var_localized_sum` carries is threaded — in particular `hstat`, which is what upgrades
`heLδ` from time `0` to *every* `t` (through `memLp_comp_pair`) and so kills the witness —
together with the (C2) repair (the printed form: the recentred residual
`e_t − e^L_t = r_t − E(r_t|X_t)` again has its error factors stripped by the conditioning,
so the small-lag half needs weights other than `f = e_0 e_j`; see
`tendsto_smallBlock_variance`). The `L¹` route then applies: the diagonal is
`localized_trunc_residual_moment_le` (`O(L^{2−δ} h)`, so `O(L^{2−δ})` after the `h⁻¹`,
uniformly in `n` — this is the half that (C1)–(C5) as frozen already supported), and the
lag halves are the (C2)/Davydov pair of ledger (a) applied to the residual array.

Note that the uniformity in `n` is genuine work: the small-lag and large-lag totals carry
the factors `m_n h_n` and `h_n^{2/δ−1+λ}|log h_n|^λ`, which tend to `0` but must be
*bounded over all `n`*, and the large-lag δ-moment constant does **not** decay in `L`
(`heδc` gives only `E(|e_0|^δ|X_0) ≤ M`, with no tail refinement), so the large-`n` and
small-`n` ranges have to be separated: for `n ≥ N` the large-lag factor is itself small,
and for the finitely many `n < N` the crude `L¹` bound
`E|S_n − S^L_n| ≤ √(n/h_n) C_W · 2 L^{1−δ} M` closes at fixed `n`.

**PROVED (this wave)**, exactly along that route. The apparatus is the private block above:
`abs_sub_clamp_le` (`|z − clamp_L z| ≤ L^{1−δ}|z|^δ`) feeds `exists_truncErr_repr_decay`,
which upgrades `exists_truncErr_repr` to a recentring constant `c = M L^{1−δ}` that *decays*
in `L`; `residual_basic` collects, at **every** `n` and `L > 0`, the `L²` membership of
`S_n − S^L_n`, the a.e.-measurability of `S^L_n` (through the same representation, the
conditional expectation inside `truncErr` never being touched directly) and the crude `L¹`
bound; `residual_variance_bound` is the uniform-in-`n` `L²` bound, assembled exactly as
ledger (a) was — diagonal from `localized_trunc_residual_moment_le` and
`localized_weight_integral_le`, small lags from (C2) at `f(z) = q(z₁)q(z₂)` with
`q(y) = |y − clamp_L y| + c`, large lags from `large_lag_covariance_bound'` — and
`norm_charFun_map_sub_le'` is the `L¹` Lipschitz bound for characteristic functions.
The split at `N` is the one described above: `N` is where `m_n h_n ≤ 1` and the Davydov
remainder `C₃ h_n^{2/δ−1+λ}|log h_n|^λ` has fallen below `κ²/2`, with `κ = ε/(|u| + 1)`; the
`L`-side then only has to kill `2(C₁L^{2−δ} + C₂L^{2−2δ})`, and the finitely many `n < N`
are closed by `Filter.eventually_all_finset` over `Finset.range N`. -/

/-! #### Ledger (b)+(d): the Bernstein-block core

The private apparatus behind `tendsto_charFun_locTruncSum`: the truncated conditional
variance `σ_L² = sL L − (mL L)²` and the (2.73) diagonal for the truncated errors; the
truncated analogue of ledger (a) over an arbitrary index family (`truncArray_core`,
`tendsto_truncArray_variance`); the shift lemma for the *pair* α-coefficient, which the
blocks need and which `pairAlphaCoeff` (anchored at `0`) does not give directly; the
big-block index apparatus and its numerology; the Volkonskii–Rozanov factorization; and the
row-CLT in product-of-charFuns form, obtained by transporting the block charFuns to an
independent surrogate on the infinite product of their laws. -/

/-- **FY (2.77)–(2.81) + (2.84), the fixed-level limit — DEBT.** For each truncation
level `L` the truncated statistic is asymptotically `N(0, ν_L)`, and `ν_L → σ²(x) p(x) ∫W²`.

This is the Bernstein-block core of §2.7.7: split `locTruncSum` into `k_n` big blocks
of length `l_n`, `k_n` small blocks of length `s_n` and a remainder; the small blocks
and remainder are `L²`-negligible (`tendsto_smallBlock_variance`); the big blocks
factorize up to `16 (k_n − 1) α_pair(s_n) → 0` by Volkonskii–Rozanov
(`norm_integral_prod_sub_prod_integral_le` with `tendsto_blockCount_mul_pairAlpha`);
and the resulting product of block charFuns converges by the degenerate-Lindeberg
corollary `tendsto_charFun_rowSum_gaussian_of_uniformly_small` — applicable because the
truncated block summands carry the envelope `l_n L CW / √(n h_n) → 0`, which is exactly
why `l_n = [√(n h_n)/log n]` is chosen. The block-variance input is ledger (a).

**Status.** All three blocking inputs are cleared: (i) ledger (a) (`var_localized_sum`, and
its truncated analogue `tendsto_truncArray_variance` built here), (ii)
`tendsto_smallBlock_variance`, (iii) the Volkonskii–Rozanov factorization
(`norm_integral_prod_sub_prod_integral_le_of_pos` in `Mixing/Inequalities.lean`; the frozen
`norm_integral_prod_sub_prod_integral_le` keeps only its false `k = 0` corner, and every
consumer here has `k = k_n ≥ 1`). Its *rate* input (2.78) is
`tendsto_blockCount_mul_pairAlpha`.

**FALSE AS FROZEN (verified) — REPAIRED.** (This superseded the earlier "statement
survives the audit intact" verdict.) The obstruction is *independent* of inputs (i)–(iii): the
conclusion is refutable even for an **iid** series, where the Bernstein blocking is
unnecessary and every one of (i)–(iii) is trivial. The point is that the hypotheses
constrain the conditional law of `e_0` given `X_0` only through its first two moments
(`hce`, `hcv`) and a δ-th moment bound (`heδc`), whereas the conclusion at a **fixed**
truncation level `L` sees the conditional law of `clamp_L(e_0)` given `X_0` — a different
functional, on which no regularity at `x` has been assumed.

*Witness.* Take `(X_t, e_t)` iid (so `pairAlphaCoeff X e μ t = 0` for `t ≥ 1` and `hα`
holds for any `lam`; take `δ = 3`, `lam = 1`, so `hδ`, `hlam` hold), `X_0` uniform on
`[0,1]` (`p = 1_{[0,1]}`, `x = 1/2`: `hmp`, `hp0`, `hpd`, `hpc`, `hpx`, `hpb` with
`Cp = 1`), `W = 1_{[1,2]}` (`hWm`, `hWb` with `C_W = 1`, `hW1`, `hW2`, `∫W² = 1`), and let
the conditional law of `e_0` given `X_0 = v` be `±c(v)` with probability `q(v)/2` each and
`0` with probability `1 − q(v)`, where `q(v) ∈ [1/4, 1/2]` and `c(v) = q(v)^{−1/2}`. Then
`E(e_0|X_0) = 0` (`hce`); `E(e_0²|X_0) = c²q = 1`, so `σ² ≡ 1` (`hcv`, `hσm`, `hσc`, and
`hσpb` with `C = 1`); `E(|e_0|³|X_0) = c³q = q^{−1/2} ≤ 2` (`heLδ`, `heδc` with `M = 2`);
and (C2) holds with `B = 1`, since for `j ≠ 0` independence factorizes
`E[|e_0 e_j| g(X_0,X_j)] = ∫∫ m(v) p(v) m(w) p(w) g` with
`m(v) = E(|e_0| | X_0 = v) = q(v)^{1/2} ≤ 1` and `E[e_0²] = 1`.

Now fix `L = 1`. As `c(v) ≥ √2 > 1`, `clamp_1(e_0)` is `±1` with probability `q(v)` and
its conditional mean vanishes, so `truncErr` has conditional variance `σ_1²(v) = q(v)` —
a function the hypotheses pin down only up to `q ∈ [1/4, 1/2]`. The summands of
`locTruncSum … 1 n` are iid, centred, bounded by `1`, with common variance
`h_n ∫ q(x + h_n u) W(u)² du`, so `Var (locTruncSum … 1 n) = ∫_1^2 q(x + h_n u) du =: V(h_n)`
and, the array being uniformly bounded by `2/√(n h_n) → 0`, the Lindeberg CLT gives
`charFun (μ.map (locTruncSum X e μ W x h 1 n)) u − exp(−u² V(h_n)/2) → 0`. Choose
`q(v) = 3/8 + (1/8) cos(2π log₂ |v − x|)`. Along `h = 2^{−k}` the phase is an integer
multiple of `2π`, so `V = 3/8 + (1/8) I`; along `h = 2^{−k−1/2}` the cosine flips sign, so
`V = 3/8 − (1/8) I`; and
`I = ∫_1^2 cos(2π log₂ u) du = (log 2)² / ((log 2)² + 4π²) > 0`. Interleaving the two
scales along a bandwidth sequence with `h_n → 0` and `n h_n³ → ∞` (e.g. `h_n` the nearer
of `2^{−k}`, `2^{−k−1/2}` to `n^{−1/4}`, alternating on long blocks — (C5) constrains only
the *rate*, not the scale) makes `V(h_n)` oscillate between two distinct values. Hence
`charFun (μ.map (locTruncSum … 1 n)) u` has no limit at any `u ≠ 0`, and **no** value of
`vT 1` can satisfy the first conclusion.

**Missing input, precisely.** FY's step (c) silently needs the diagonal (2.73) *for the
truncated errors*: continuity at `x` of `σ_L² · p` for each `L`, where
`σ_L²(v) = Var(clamp_L(e_0) | X_0 = v)`. This is a **fourth** silent reading of (C1),
independent of `hσm`/`hσpb` (which regularize only `σ² = σ_∞²`) and of `heδc`/`hpb` (which
bound only a δ-th moment). The economical repair is to assume that the conditional law of
`e_0` given `X_0 = v` converges weakly to the one at `v = x` as `v → x`, together with
uniform square-integrability along that limit: this yields continuity at `x` of `σ_L² · p`
for every `L` *and* FY's (2.84) `σ_L²(x) → σ²(x)` as `L → ∞`, which is the second
conclusion. Note that the **headline** `kernel_localized_clt` is *not* damaged by this: it
is an artifact of the truncation route only, and the untruncated variance asymptotics
`var_localized_sum` — which is what the headline's Gaussian limit is read off — is proved.

**Statement strengthening (documented).** The repair applied is exactly the missing input
above, in its most economical Lean form: measurable versions `mL L`, `sL L` of
`v ↦ E(clamp_L e_0 | X_0 = v)` and `v ↦ E(clamp_L(e_0)² | X_0 = v)` — whose existence is
Doob–Dynkin (`StronglyMeasurable.exists_eq_measurable_comp`), not an assumption — together
with the three genuine hypotheses on `σ_L² := sL L − (mL L)²`:
`hσLc` (continuity at `x` of `σ_L²·p`, which is the (2.73)-for-truncated-errors that the
witness above refutes as underivable), `hσLb` (`σ_L²·p` bounded, the level-`L` form of the
already-authorized `hσpb`), and `hσL84` (FY's (2.84) `σ_L²(x) → σ²(x)`, which is the second
conclusion; it is *not* implied by `hσLc` — a.e.-in-`v` convergence `σ_L² → σ²` plus
continuity of each factor at `x` says nothing about the value at the single point `x`).
All three are consequences of the one conceptual repair the witness identifies, namely that
the conditional law of `e_0` given `X_0 = v` converges weakly to the one at `v = x` as
`v → x` with uniform square-integrability; they are stated directly because that weak-limit
formulation is heavier and buys nothing else. The two (2.74) hypotheses `heδc`/`hpb` are
carried here solely because this statement consumes ledger (a); see `var_localized_sum`'s
docstring for the proof that they are not derivable from (C1)–(C5) as formalized.

**PROVED (this wave), in the repaired form.** The Bernstein-block core was run in full. The
private apparatus, in the order it is built above, is:
* `condExp_truncErr_sq` — `E((e^L_0)² | X_0) = sL L(X_0) − mL L(X_0)²`, i.e. the truncated
  array's conditional variance really is the `σ_L²` of the repair; with `truncErr_zero_repr`
  and `ae_abs_mL_le` (`|mL L| ≤ L` a.e., since `mL L` is a version of a conditional
  expectation of something bounded by `L`).
* `tendsto_truncDiag` — the (2.73) diagonal *for the truncated errors*, obtained from the
  proved `tendsto_localized_second_moment_debt` at `σ_L²`; note that `hσLc` gives continuity
  of the **product** `σ_L²·p` only, and continuity of `σ_L²` itself is recovered from it by
  dividing by `p`, which is legitimate exactly because `p` is continuous at `x` with
  `p x > 0`.
* `truncArray_core` / `tendsto_truncArray_variance` — the truncated analogue of the whole of
  ledger (a), over an **arbitrary** index family `I n ⊆ range n` with `|I n|/n → a`, with
  limit `a · σ_L²(x) p(x) ∫W²`. It is `tendsto_truncIndex_variance` with the diagonal
  *retained* (`abs_double_sum_subset_sub_diag_le`) instead of discarded; at `a = 1` it is
  FY's (2.77) variance and at `a = 0` it is the negligibility of the discarded indices.
* `pairAlphaCoeff_shift` — the **anchor-independence** of the pair α-coefficient, which the
  blocks need and which `pairAlphaCoeff` (anchored at `0`) does not give: the pair series is
  coded into a *real* series by a Borel isomorphism `ℝ × ℝ ≃ᵐ ℝ` (`pairCode`), whose one-time
  comap σ-algebra is exactly `σ(X_t) ⊔ σ(e_t)`; fdd stationarity of the pair upgrades to
  `IsStrictlyStationary` of the coded series (`map_tuple_shift`: an arbitrary finite tuple is
  covered by one contiguous window), and `IsStrictlyStationary.alphaMixCoeff_shift` of
  `Mixing/Relations.lean` applies.
* the big-block apparatus `bigBlockIdx` (+ disjointness, `bigBlockIdx_card = k_n l_n`, the
  bookkeeping identity `k l + k s + n mod (l+s) = n`) with the two new ratio limits
  `l_n/n → 0` and `s_n/n → 0` (the latter from (C5) through
  `tendsto_log_rpow_div_rpow_atTop`, exactly as in `tendsto_blockCount_mul_smallBlockLen_div`),
  giving `|range n \ bigBlockIdx|/n → 0` and `|bigBlockIdx|/n → 1`.
* `tendsto_blockVar_sum` — `Σ_j Var(Y_{n,j}) → σ_L²(x) p(x) ∫W²` for the big-block statistics,
  by applying the sub-diagonal double-sum estimate blockwise (the cross-block covariances are
  absorbed by the *same* lag sum `h⁻¹ Σ_{d≥1}|G(d)| → 0`).
* `norm_charFun_blockSum_sub_prod_le` — Volkonskii–Rozanov on the big blocks; the gap
  hypothesis is `α(σ_pair(Iic (jq+l)), σ_pair(Ici ((j+1)q+1))) ≤ α_pair(s_n)`, which is where
  `pairAlphaCoeff_shift` is consumed.
* `tendsto_prod_charFun_of_uniformly_small` — the row CLT in **product-of-charFuns** form,
  with *no* independence assumed. `tendsto_charFun_rowSum_gaussian_of_uniformly_small` is only
  available in its `iIndepFun` form (its product-form core is `private` in
  `ForMathlib/Probability/TriangularCLT.lean`), so the product `∏_j φ_{Y_{n,j}}(u)` is
  transported to an independent surrogate on `Measure.infinitePi` of the individual laws,
  where the theorem applies verbatim.
* `tendsto_bigBlockLen_div_sqrt` — the envelope `l_n/√(n h_n) → 0` (with `n h_n → ∞` from
  (C5)), which is what makes the block array uniformly negligible; and the `L² ⇒ L¹` glue
  `tendsto_integral_abs_of_tendsto_sq`.

The degenerate truncation levels `L ≤ 0` are handled separately: there `clamp_L ≡ −L` is
constant, so `truncErr ≡ 0` and the statistic is a.s. `0`; `vT` is defined to be `0` there, and
`gaussianReal 0 0 = δ_0` matches. -/

/-- **FY Theorem 2.22** (charFun form): under (C1)–(C5),
`(n h_n)^{-1/2} Σ_{t=1}^n e_t W((X_t − x)/h_n) →d N(0, σ²(x) p(x) ∫ W²)`.

**Statement strengthening (documented).** Four groups of hypotheses beyond the printed
(C1)–(C5) are carried, each a silent reading of (C1)–(C2) that FY's own proof uses, and
each documented with an explicit proof that it is *not* derivable from the frozen
conditions:
* `hσm` (`σ²` measurable — the printed (C1) constrains `σ²` only through `hcv`, hence only
  `μ.map (X 0)`-a.e.) and `hσpb` (`σ²·p` bounded), needed for the diagonal (2.73); see
  `tendsto_localized_second_moment_debt` (spike/kernel counterexample).
* `heδc`/`hpb` — FY's implicit (2.74), the *conditional* δ-th moment
  `E(|e_0|^δ | X_0) ≤ M` together with a bounded density — needed for the large-lag half of
  the variance asymptotics; see `var_localized_sum` (interpolation of the available inputs
  converges only for `λ > 1`, whereas (C3) allows `λ ∈ (1 − 2/δ, 1]`).
* (C2) is carried **as printed** — the integrated bounded-conditional-density inequality at
  an *arbitrary* error weight `f`, not just at `f = e_0 e_j`. The frozen single instance is
  strictly weaker and does not close steps (b)–(c): the conditional recentring inside
  `truncErr` strips both error factors out of the small-lag covariance. See
  `tendsto_smallBlock_variance` for the proof.
* `mL`/`sL` with `hσLc`, `hσLb`, `hσL84` — the *truncated* conditional second moment
  `σ_L² = sL L − (mL L)²` is regular at `x`, and FY's (2.84) holds. This is a **fourth**
  reading of (C1), independent of the first two (which regularize `σ² = σ_∞²` only), and it
  is what step (c) needs at each fixed truncation level; see
  `tendsto_charFun_locTruncSum` for the iid witness that refutes the statement without it.

Note that the *Gaussian limit itself* is untouched by the last item: it is read off the
untruncated variance asymptotics `var_localized_sum`, which is proved. -/
